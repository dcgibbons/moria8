# Moria C64/C128 — Build Plan

## The Problem

Umoria's data footprint (~90-110 KB of game tables, map, and text) far exceeds the
C64's ~38 KB of usable RAM. The original runs on an 80x24 terminal; the C64 has 40x25.
Every design decision flows from these two constraints.

---

## Memory Budget (C64)

| Region | Address | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zero page (BASIC area) | $02–$8F | ~140 bytes | Hot variables, pointers (see ZP notes below) |
| Program code | $0801–$9FFF | ~38 KB | Code + resident data |
| RAM under BASIC ROM | $A000–$BFFF | 8 KB | Banked data (creature tiers) |
| Free RAM (no banking) | $C000–$CFFF | 4 KB | Dungeon map (3,840 bytes at $C000–$CEFF) + floor item table (256 bytes at $CF00–$CFFF) — always accessible |
| RAM under KERNAL ROM | $E000–$FFFF | 8 KB | Banked data (item tiers 4,000 bytes, monster recall 1,200 bytes, spell tables ~1 KB, ~1.8 KB free) |
| Screen RAM | $0400–$07E7 | 1 KB | Display |
| Color RAM | $D800–$DBE7 | 1 KB | Display colors |
| **Total usable** | | **~58 KB** | With banking (code + all banked regions) |

On the C128, the full 128 KB is available through bank switching, which gives us
much more room. The design should target C64 as the constrained baseline.

**Zero page KERNAL conflicts:** Although $02–$8F is nominally free from BASIC,
some locations are clobbered by KERNAL routines. In particular, $22–$25 are used
by KERNAL LOAD/SAVE, $14–$15 by KERNAL OPEN, and several others by KERNAL I/O.
The `zeropage.s` module must document which ZP locations are safe to use freely
vs. which must be saved/restored around KERNAL calls (especially data_loader.s
and save.s). Divide ZP into "permanent" variables (never touched by KERNAL) and
"volatile" variables (caller-save around KERNAL calls).

**Banking note — $E000–$FFFF:** When KERNAL ROM is banked out, hardware IRQ/NMI
vectors at $FFFE/$FFFF read from RAM. All access to this region must be wrapped
in SEI/bank-out/access/bank-in/CLI sequences. Because this overhead is expensive,
**the dungeon map must NOT live here** — it goes in the always-accessible $C000
region instead. Reserve $E000–$FFFF for infrequent bulk access (tier data loading,
save/load).

---

## Data Compression Strategy

The raw umoria data must be reduced to fit. Here is the approach for each major
data set:

### Dungeon Map

Original: 66 rows x 198 columns x 4 bytes = ~52 KB. **This cannot fit.**

**Redesigned map:** 40 columns x 24 rows per screen, with a dungeon of 80 x 48
tiles total (4 screens, 2x2 grid) = 3,840 tiles.

Each tile is encoded in a single byte:
- Bits 7–4: tile type (wall, floor, door, stairs, rubble, magma, quartz — 16 types)
- Bit 3: lit flag
- Bit 2: visited/known flag
- Bit 1: treasure present flag (index into separate small treasure-on-floor table)
- Bit 0: creature present flag (index into active creature table)

Map cost: 3,840 bytes (~3.75 KB) at $C000–$CEFF.

**Sparse lookup tables:** Tile bits 0 and 1 are boolean flags only — they indicate
presence, not identity. To find WHICH creature or item is at a given tile,
scan the corresponding runtime table for a position match:

- **Active monster table:** Up to 32 entries x 12 bytes (position, creature type
  index, current HP, status flags, speed counter) = 384 bytes. Stored in main
  RAM ($0801–$9FFF). Linear scan of 32 entries per tile lookup is fast.
- **Floor item table:** Up to 32 entries x 8 bytes (position, item template index,
  enchantment, quantity) = 256 bytes. Stored at $CF00–$CFFF (remainder of the
  $C000 region after the map). 32 floor items per level is sufficient given
  the 80x48 map size — items beyond this limit are not spawned.

### Creature Data

Original: 351 creatures x ~45 bytes = ~15.8 KB.

**Tiered loading:** Group creatures into depth tiers:
- Tier 0 (town): creatures 0–19 (~20 types)
- Tier 1 (levels 1–5): creatures 20–69 (~50 types)
- Tier 2 (levels 6–10): creatures 70–129 (~60 types)
- Tier 3 (levels 11–20): creatures 130–209 (~80 types)
- Tier 4 (levels 21–50): creatures 210–279 (~70 types)

Only 2 adjacent tiers are in memory at once. Compressed to ~24 bytes per creature
(2-byte tokenized name index into string dictionary, pack flags into 2 bytes,
pack attacks into 8 bytes, remaining fields in 12 bytes). Do NOT truncate names
to 8 characters — use the PETSCII token compression system (see Text and Names
below) to preserve full creature names while storing only a 2-byte dictionary
index per creature:
- Largest pair: Tier 3 + Tier 4 = 150 types x 24 bytes = 3,600 bytes

Stored in RAM under BASIC ROM ($A000–$BFFF). This region is dedicated to creature
data only. Item data is stored separately in RAM under KERNAL ROM ($E000–$FFFF)
to avoid overflowing the 8 KB BASIC ROM region (creature + item data combined
would be 7,600 bytes — too tight for a single 8 KB region with no margin).

### Item/Treasure Data

Original: 420 items x ~35 bytes = ~14.7 KB.

**Same tiered approach:** Items grouped by minimum dungeon level, loaded alongside
creature tiers. Compressed to ~20 bytes per item (tokenized names, packed fields):
- ~200 items in any 2-tier window x 20 bytes = 4,000 bytes

Item tier data is stored in RAM under KERNAL ROM ($E000–$FFFF), separate from
creature tier data ($A000–$BFFF). Item lookups are less frequent than creature
lookups (AI runs every turn; item lookups happen on player action), so the
SEI/bank overhead for KERNAL RAM access is acceptable here.

### Text and Names

Monster names, item names, class titles, spell names, store dialogue — the
original has several KB of strings.

**PETSCII token compression:** Build a dictionary of common fragments (e.g.,
"potion of ", "scroll of ", " resistance", "sword", "dagger"). Names are stored
as sequences of token indices + literal bytes. Expect 40-60% compression.

**String dictionary location:** The compressed dictionary (`strings.bin`, estimated
~2–3 KB) must be **always resident in the main code region** ($0801–$9FFF).
Creature and item names are displayed during combat, LOS reveal, inventory, and
store screens — too frequently to tolerate banking overhead. Creature/item records
store a 2-byte index into this dictionary. The decompression routine expands
tokens to screen codes on the fly during display.

### Monster Recall

Original: 351 creatures x ~16 bytes = 5.6 KB.

**On disk:** Only the current tier pair's recall data is in memory (~150 x 8
bytes = 1,200 bytes, reduced fields). Recall is stored in the $E000 banked
region alongside item data.

**Recall lifecycle on tier change:** When the player crosses a tier boundary,
the outgoing tier pair's accumulated recall must be written to disk before
loading the incoming tier's recall. On tier change: (1) save current recall
to a per-tier file on disk (e.g., `recall_t1.bin`), (2) load new tier's
creature + item data, (3) load new tier's recall from disk (if file exists;
otherwise initialize to zero). On game save, the current tier's recall is
saved in the save file as before — the per-tier recall files on disk handle
the other tiers. This preserves accumulated recall across the full game,
matching original Moria behavior where recall is cumulative and permanent.
The extra disk I/O for recall save/load adds ~4 seconds stock (~1 second
with fastloader) per tier change — acceptable given tier changes already
require disk access.

## Phase Plan

### Phase 1 — Skeleton and Infrastructure

**Goal:** A program that boots on C64/C128, displays text, accepts input, and
can be tested.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | `main.s` | BASIC stub ($0801), SYS entry, save BASIC ZP state ($02–$8F) to buffer, disable BASIC ROM, call init, main loop. IRQ: keep the default KERNAL IRQ handler active (required for keyboard scanning used by GETIN in `input.s`). If a custom raster IRQ is needed later (e.g., for split-screen effects), chain it to the KERNAL handler via the saved vector. Clean exit: restore ZP state, re-enable BASIC ROM, RTS to BASIC warm start. Select unshifted character set mode (uppercase + graphics) at startup. | Boots in VICE, exits cleanly, BASIC works after exit, keyboard responsive |
| 1.2 | `config.s` | Detect C64 vs C128, detect 40/80 column mode, store machine type in ZP | Returns correct machine ID |
| 1.3 | `zeropage.s` | Define ZP variable locations for all modules using BASIC's freed space ($02–$8F). Document two zones: "safe" (never touched by KERNAL) and "volatile" (clobbered by KERNAL LOAD/SAVE/OPEN — $14–$15, $22–$25, etc.). Volatile ZP must be caller-saved around KERNAL calls in data_loader.s and save.s. | Symbols resolve, no overlap, KERNAL-safe zones documented |
| 1.4 | `memory.s` | Bank switching macros: bank out BASIC ROM, bank out KERNAL ROM (with SEI/CLI protection), copy routines for banked RAM | Read/write behind ROM works |
| 1.5 | `screen.s` | Clear screen, print string at (row,col), print char, set colors, scroll message area. Uses direct screen memory writes (not KERNAL CHROUT) for performance. All output goes through a vector table (`put_char`, `put_string`, `clear_screen`, `set_color`) so the VDC 80-column backend can be swapped in for Phase 10 without changing callers. Overhead is ~6 cycles per indirect JMP — negligible. | Text appears correctly |
| 1.6 | `input.s` | Wait for keypress (KERNAL GETIN), key-to-command mapping table, handle direction keys. Numeric prefix for repeats deferred to Phase 6+. | Correct key codes returned |
| 1.7 | `rng.s` | 32-bit Galois LFSR seeded from CIA timer, `randByte` and `randRange` routines. A 16-bit LCG only has 65,536 states and produces noticeable repetition in dungeon generation; 32-bit LFSR has 4 billion states at ~20 cycles per call. | Statistical distribution test, no short-period repetition |
| 1.8 | `math.s` | 8x8→16 multiply, 16/8→8 divide, dice roll (NdS+B) | Boundary value tests |
| 1.9 | `turn.s` | Turn processing routines: `turn_post_action` (called by main loop after player actions) runs effect timers → hunger tick → increment turn counter → mark status dirty. Monster AI and regeneration added in Phase 5. Main loop in `main.s` handles command dispatch and rendering. | Turn post-action runs correctly |
| 1.10 | `sound.s` | Minimal SID sound effects: bump (wall collision), hit (combat), miss (combat), pickup (item), death (game over). Simple waveform + ADSR envelope per effect, no music. | Sounds play without disrupting gameplay timing |

**Deliverable:** Program boots, shows "MORIA" title, waits for a keypress, exits
to BASIC. All infrastructure routines have passing unit tests.

---

### Phase 2 — Player and Character Creation

**Goal:** Create a character with race, class, stats, and display the character
sheet.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | `tables.s` | Race stat modifiers (8 races x 6 stats), class data (6 classes), XP level thresholds (40 levels), stat bonus tables | Data integrity checks |
| 2.2 | `player.s` | Player struct in memory (~200 bytes), accessors for stats/HP/mana/gold/level, stat bonus lookups | Get/set round-trip |
| 2.3 | `player_create.s` | Race selection, stat rolling (umoria algorithm: 18 dice cycling d3/d4/d5, constrained total 43–54, each stat = 5 + 3 consecutive dice, race modifiers via incrementStat/decrementStat — see Stat Generation Deep Dive in Audit Review), class selection (filtered by race), name entry (max 16 chars, uppercase only — matches unshifted character set), initialize starting HP/mana/inventory. Order: race → stats → class → name (stat roll shows race-adjusted previews before class is chosen). | Full creation flow in VICE |
| 2.4 | `ui_character.s` | Character sheet display (name, race, class, stats, level, HP, mana, AC, gold), stat detail view | Screen output matches data |
| 2.5 | `ui_status.s` | Bottom status line: HP, mana, dungeon level, player level. Update on change only (dirty flag). | Status reflects player state |
| 2.6 | `ui_messages.s` | Top message line: display message, "—more—" prompt for overflow, message history buffer (last 8 messages) | Messages display, more works |

**Deliverable:** Player can roll a character, see their stats, and the status bar
and message system work.

---

### Phase 3 — The Town Level

**Goal:** Generate and display the town, move the player around it.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | `dungeon_gen.s` (town portion) | Generate town level: outer boundary walls, 6 store buildings (10x5 each with door), staircase to dungeon, open areas. Fixed layout (no RNG needed). | Town structure matches spec |
| 3.2 | `dungeon_render.s` | Tile-to-screen-code mapping table (see Screen Code table below), render visible portion of map to screen, handle 40-col viewport (38x20 game area with border), cursor positioning for player `@` symbol | Map renders correctly |
| 3.3 | `player_move.s` | 8-direction movement via HJKLYUBN (vi-keys) and cursor keys. Numpad keys 1–9 deferred to Phase 10 (C128 enhancements). Collision with walls, enter store door (triggers store screen), step on stairs. Running (auto-move in a direction until interrupted by obstacle, monster, or intersection) deferred to Phase 4.6 — requires dungeon corridors. | Movement works, walls block |
| 3.4 | `dungeon_los.s` | Simple town LOS: everything in town is lit and visible. Player position tracking, map reveal. (Full LOS in Phase 4.5.) | Visibility correct |

**Tile Mapping (40-column) — Screen Codes for Direct Memory Writes:**

These are **screen codes** (values poked directly into screen RAM at $0400+),
NOT PETSCII codes (which are different and used with KERNAL CHROUT). All
rendering uses direct screen memory writes for performance.

**Tile types (bits 7–4) — 16 codes, all used:**

| Type Code | Tile | Glyph | Screen Code | Color |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Floor | `.` (period) | $2E | Dark grey ($0B) |
| 1 | Wall (horizontal) | `─` (horiz line) | $40 | Light grey ($0F) |
| 2 | Wall (vertical) | `│` (vert line) | $5D | Light grey ($0F) |
| 3 | Wall (corner TL) | `┌` | $70 | Light grey ($0F) |
| 4 | Wall (corner TR) | `┐` | $6E | Light grey ($0F) |
| 5 | Wall (corner BL) | `└` | $6D | Light grey ($0F) |
| 6 | Wall (corner BR) | `┘` | $7D | Light grey ($0F) |
| 7 | Door (open) | `'` | $27 | Brown ($09) |
| 8 | Door (closed) | `+` | $2B | Brown ($09) |
| 9 | Stairs down | `>` | $3E | White ($01) |
| 10 | Stairs up | `<` | $3C | White ($01) |
| 11 | Rubble | `:` | $3A | Grey ($0C) |
| 12 | Magma stream | `#` | $23 | Red ($02) |
| 13 | Quartz vein | `%` | $25 | White ($01) |
| 14 | Trap (visible) | `^` (up arrow) | $1E | Red ($02) |
| 15 | Secret door | (wall glyph) | (same as adjacent wall) | (same as wall, until found) |

**Rendering states (not tile types — derived from flags or context):**

| State | Glyph | Screen Code | Color | How determined |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Player | `@` | $00 | White ($01) | Player position (always drawn on top) |
| Store (number) | `1`–`6` | $31–$36 | Yellow ($07) | Town gen marks floor tiles; renderer checks store table |
| Gold / floor item | `$` | $24 | Yellow ($07) | Bit 1 (treasure flag) set; renderer checks floor item table |
| Unknown/unseen | (not drawn) | — | Black (background) | Bit 2 (visited flag) = 0; tile type stored but not rendered |
| Monster | letter | varies | threat-coded | Bit 0 (creature flag) set; renderer checks active monster table |

**Screen code conversion note:** PETSCII and screen codes are different encodings.
For ASCII-range characters ($20–$3F), values are identical. For graphic characters:
PETSCII $A0–$BF → screen code = PETSCII − $40; PETSCII $C0–$DF → screen code =
PETSCII − $80. The values above are verified screen codes for the unshifted
character set. Do NOT use PETSCII values (e.g., $C0 for `─`) in direct screen
writes — $C0 as a screen code renders as reverse-video horizontal bar.

**Character set mode:** The game uses **unshifted mode** (uppercase + graphics
characters). This provides the box-drawing characters needed for walls but means
all text is uppercase only. This matches the retro feel and is standard for C64
games. The character set is selected at startup in `main.s` via the $D018
register. No custom character set is loaded.

**Color palette:** Colors are written to color RAM ($D800+) alongside screen
codes. The palette above improves readability by distinguishing structural
elements (grey walls), interactive elements (brown doors, yellow stores), and
the player (white). Monster colors are defined in Phase 5 — threat-coded by
depth relative to player level.

**Deliverable:** Town level renders, player walks around with `@`, bumps into
walls, store numbers visible, stairs visible.

---

### Phase 4 — Dungeon Generation and Navigation

**Goal:** Generate dungeon levels and navigate between them.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | `dungeon_gen.s` (full) | Room-and-corridor generation for dungeon levels. 80x48 map. Place N rooms (4–8 for simplicity), connect with tunnels, add doors, place stairs (2 down, 1 up), add mineral streamers. Room types: basic rectangle + overlapping. | Rooms connected, stairs present |
| 4.2 | `dungeon_features.s` | Door open/close/lock/jam logic, trap placement (6 types: pit, arrow, gas, teleport, dart, rockfall), staircase level transitions, secret door detection | Traps trigger correctly |
| 4.3 | `data_loader.s` + `fastload.s` | Load creature/item tier data from disk to banked RAM on level change using fast IEC loader. Track current tier pair — only reload on tier boundary crossing, and skip the load entirely if the same tier pair is re-requested (prevents repeated disk I/O when player yo-yos between adjacent tier-boundary levels like 5↔6). **Banking note:** On the 6502, CPU writes always go to RAM regardless of ROM banking state — only reads are affected. This means KERNAL LOAD (or the fastloader) can write directly to $A000 or $E000 without banking out ROM first. However, **bank out BASIC ROM before loading to $A000** so the data can be read back immediately after load (reads from $A000 with BASIC ROM banked in return ROM contents, not the loaded data). For $E000, the same principle applies: writes land in RAM automatically, but KERNAL ROM must be banked out (with SEI/CLI) to read the data back. **File organization:** Creature data, item data, and recall data are separate files per tier (`creatures_tN.bin`, `items_tN.bin`, `recall_tN.bin`). Recall files are created at runtime as the player accumulates knowledge. **Tier change sequence:** (1) save current recall to disk, (2) load new creature tier to $A000, (3) load new item tier to $E000, (4) load new recall from disk if it exists (else zero-init). See Monster Recall section and Design Decision #11. | Correct data after load, tier caching works, recall persists across tier changes, load time <3s with fastloader |
| 4.4 | `dungeon_render.s` (viewport) | Viewport scrolling for 80x48 map on 38x20 screen. Panel movement when player nears edge. Draw only changed tiles (dirty tile tracking). | Viewport scrolls correctly |
| 4.5 | `dungeon_los.s` (full) | Hybrid LOS matching original Moria behavior: lit rooms reveal fully when player enters (check room membership, not per-tile rays). Dark corridors reveal only adjacent tiles. Bresenham ray casting reserved for specific checks (ranged attacks, bolt spells in Phase 7) — not used for general visibility, as per-tile ray casting is too expensive at 1 MHz for every player move. Torch/lamp extends corridor visibility to light-radius adjacent tiles. | LOS matches expected pattern |
| 4.6 | Player movement updates | Walking into darkness, falling in pits, hitting traps, going up/down stairs transitions. Searching reveals secret doors (1-in-6 base). Running: auto-move in a direction until interrupted by wall, intersection, visible monster, or item on floor. Running is essential QoL for traversing explored corridors. | Transitions work, running stops at obstacles |

**Deliverable:** Multi-level dungeon with rooms, corridors, doors, traps, and
lighting. Player can descend and ascend.

---

### Phase 5 — Monsters

**Goal:** Monsters appear, move, and can be fought.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | `monster.s` | Active monster table (up to 32 simultaneous — reduced from 125 for C64 RAM). Spawn routine: pick creature type appropriate to depth, place in valid empty tile. Monster display characters. | Monsters spawn at correct depth |
| 5.2 | `monster_ai.s` | Monster movement: awake/sleep check (noise radius), greedy step toward player, confused wandering, wall-phasing for ghosts. Variable speed: each creature type has a speed value (1 = normal, 2 = fast/moves twice per player turn, 0 = slow/moves every other turn). The turn sequencer (`turn.s`) checks speed counters and calls AI accordingly. Speed is a core tactical mechanic — fast hounds are dangerous because they outrun you, slow molds are manageable because you can kite them. | Monsters approach player, fast monsters move twice per turn |
| 5.3 | `player_combat.s` | Melee attack: blow count from table (dex x weight ratio), to-hit roll (d20 + bonuses vs AC), damage roll (weapon dice + str bonus). Kill awards XP, check level-up. | Damage/kill/XP correct |
| 5.4 | `monster_attack.s` | Monster melee: up to 4 attacks per creature, damage types (normal, poison, stat drain, gold theft, item theft). Attack messages. Player death check. | Attacks deal correct damage |
| 5.5 | `player_effects.s` | Status effect application and timers: poison tick, blindness (hide map), confusion (random movement), paralysis (skip turns), regeneration (HP/mana per turn based on CON). | Timers decrement, effects apply |
| 5.6 | `dungeon_render.s` (monsters) | Show monster characters on map. Monster visibility (only in LOS and lit). Monsters blink or highlight on attack. | Monsters visible when expected |

**Deliverable:** Monsters wander the dungeon, attack the player, the player can
fight back. Status effects work. Combat is functional.

---

### Phase 6 — Items and Inventory

**Goal:** Items can be found, carried, equipped, used, and dropped.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | `inventory.s` | Inventory data structure: 22 carried slots + 8 equipment slots (reduced from umoria). Item struct (~16 bytes: type, subtype, flags, plus/damage/AC, quantity, id-status). Add/remove/stack operations. | Add/remove/stack correct |
| 6.2 | `ui_inventory.s` | Display inventory list (letter-indexed a–v), equipment list, item detail view. 40-column formatting with scrolling for overflow. | Display matches contents |
| 6.3 | `player_items.s` | Equip/remove/drop/pick-up commands. Wear/wield calculates AC and to-hit changes. Cursed items cannot be removed. Eat food (hunger system: full → hungry → weak → fainting → dead). | Equip changes stats |
| 6.4 | Item generation | Floor item spawning during dungeon gen. Gold pile generation. Treasure rooms. Chest contents. Item enchantment rolling (+1 to +N based on depth). | Items spawn at correct depth |
| 6.5 | Item identification | Unidentified items show generic name ("a blue potion"). Identify scroll/spell reveals true name. "Tried" status after first use. Scroll/potion/wand color randomization per game. | ID progression works |

**Deliverable:** Full item lifecycle — find, pick up, identify, equip, use, drop.
Hunger system functional.

---

### Phase 7 — Magic System

**Goal:** Mages cast spells, priests pray, scrolls/potions/wands work.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | `player_magic.s` | Spell/prayer book display, learn new spells on level-up, cast spell (mana cost, failure chance based on level+INT/WIS), spell cooldown. 16 mage spells + 16 priest prayers (reduced from 31 each). | Cast succeeds/fails correctly |
| 7.2 | Spell effects | Implement each spell: magic missile, light area, detect monsters, phase door, fireball, teleport self, identify, cure poison, cure wounds, bless, remove curse, etc. | Each effect works |
| 7.3 | Scrolls/potions | Use item → apply effect → consume item. 20 scroll types, 20 potion types (reduced). Effects overlap spell system where possible (share subroutines). | Items consumed, effects apply |
| 7.4 | Wands/staves | Directional targeting for wands (aim in 8 directions). Staves affect area. Charge tracking. | Charges decrement |
| 7.5 | `monster_magic.s` | Monster spellcasting: breath weapons (damage = current HP fraction), bolt spells, summoning, teleport player, blindness, confusion. Check range, check LOS. | Monsters cast when in range |

**Deliverable:** Full magic system for both player and monsters.

### Phase 8 — Stores ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Goal:** Town stores buy and sell items.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | `store.s` | 6 stores with inventory (12 items each — reduced from 24). Store owner data (name only — race and max gold deferred, see RP14-2/RP14-5). Inventory restocking on town re-entry. (Design deviation: original Moria restocks based on game turns elapsed, not on re-entry. Simplified for implementation; acceptable because the net effect is similar — stores refresh between dungeon visits.) | Stores stock correct items |
| 8.2 | `ui_store.s` | Store screen: list items with prices, buy/sell interface. Simplified haggling (accept/decline at offered price, no multi-round bidding — optional enhancement later). Store entry detected via `check_player_on_store_door` at `!post_move:` in main loop. Sell flow uses sub-screen to show full 22-slot player inventory. | Buy/sell transactions work |
| 8.3 | Price calculation | Base price × charisma modifier only (race modifier deferred, see RP14-2). Buy: `base_price × chr_price_adj[CHR-3] / 100` (100-130%). Sell: `base_price × chr_sell_adj[CHR-3] / 100` (25-50%). Uses `math_mul_16x8` (16×8→24-bit multiply, added to `math.s`) and existing `math_div_16x8`. | Prices match formula (17 tests) |

**Implementation details:**
- **New files:** `store.s` (474 lines — data, restock, pricing, gold ops), `ui_store.s` (~500 lines — entry detection, screen rendering, buy/sell flows), `tests/test_store.s` (17 runtime tests)
- **Modified files:** `main.s` (imports + 3 hooks: init, restock on ascend, door check at post_move), `math.s` (added `math_mul_16x8`), `tables.s` (added `chr_sell_adj` 16-byte table), `run_tests.sh` (added store suite)
- **Store inventory:** SoA layout — `si_item_id`, `si_qty`, `si_p1`, `si_flags` (72 slots = 6 stores × 12). Category matching via 16-bit bitmasks (`store_cat_mask_lo/hi`).
- **Restocking:** `store_init_all` at game start; `store_restock_all` on stair ascent to town. Each empty slot has 50% chance to stock. Item selection via rejection sampling (`rng_range(45)+2`, check category, max 30 retries, fallback table).
- **Branch distance issues:** Several routines required `bcc/jmp` patterns and subroutine extraction to stay within 6502's ±128 byte relative branch limit.
- **math_multiply clobbers X:** `math_mul_16x8` saves X in `mul_saved_x` before first `math_multiply` call.
- **Test framework note:** Data bytes after `brk` shift segment end address, breaking `run_tests.sh` VICE breakpoint detection. All scratch data must be placed before `brk`. (See RP14-6.)
- **Verification:** `make build` → 57 asserts, 0 failed. `make test` → 13/13 suites pass (186 total tests, store 17/17).

**Deliverable:** Player can buy equipment and sell loot in town.

---

### Phase 9 — Save/Load and Game Polish

**Goal:** Game state persists across sessions. Death and scoring work.

| # | File | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9.1 | `save.s` | Save game: write player struct, current dungeon map, active monsters, floor item table, inventory, current tier recall data, game flags to sequential file on disk. Compress map (RLE on tile bytes). Estimated save size: ~3–5 KB. | Save and reload match, all floor items and monsters persist |
| 9.2 | Load game | Load from disk, validate file integrity (checksum), **delete savefile immediately after successful load** (before resuming play — this enforces permadeath and prevents save-scumming via machine reset), restore all state, resume play. | Game resumes correctly, savefile gone |
| 9.3 | Death and scores | Death screen with killer info. High score table (top 10, stored on disk). Score = XP + gold + depth bonus. | Scores persist |
| 9.4 | Game polish | Title screen with ASCII art (PETSCII). Help screen (command reference). Difficulty tuning pass. | Screens display |

**Deliverable:** Complete, playable game loop from title screen through death
and high scores.

---

### Phase 10 — C128 Enhancements

**Goal:** Take advantage of C128 hardware when available.

| # | What | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | 80-column mode | VDC-based rendering for 80x25 display. Larger viewport (78x20). Full-width status bar. **Note:** The VDC has its own 16 KB RAM accessed only through register ports ($D600/$D601) — screen memory is NOT directly addressable. Every character write requires a multi-step register sequence (set address high, set address low, write data). This is architecturally different from VIC-II direct screen pokes and effectively requires a **second rendering backend**, not just wider output. Design screen.s with an abstract interface from Phase 1 so the VDC renderer can be swapped in. |
| 10.2 | Extended memory | Use C128's 128 KB to hold all creature/item tiers simultaneously — no disk loading between levels. |
| 10.3 | Larger dungeon | With more RAM, expand dungeon to 120x80 or larger. More rooms, more monsters (up to 64 active). |
| 10.4 | Enhanced display | Use VDC attributes for color-coded monsters (red = dangerous, green = easy). Reverse video for walls. |

```

**Key parallelism:** Phases 5 (Monsters) and 6 (Items) are **independent peers**
after Phase 4 and can be developed in parallel. Items do not depend on monsters.
Phase 7 (Magic) depends on **both** Phase 5 (Monsters) for `monster_magic.s`
(breath weapons, monster spellcasting) **and** Phase 6 (Items) for scroll/potion/wand
infrastructure — both must be complete before Phase 7 begins.
Phase 8 (Stores) needs Phase 3 (Town) for the store locations and Phase 6 (Items)
for the item system. Phase 9 can begin once enough game state exists to be worth
saving (after Phase 4 at earliest).

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Reduced Dungeon Size (80x48 vs 66x198)

The original 13,068-tile map is replaced with 3,840 tiles. This is still large
enough for interesting exploration (4 screen-sized rooms connected by corridors)
and fits in ~4 KB. Deeper levels can use the same 80x48 but with denser room
placement.

### 2. Reduced Monster/Item Counts

Active monsters capped at 32 (vs 125). Item templates reduced to ~250 (vs 420).
Inventory slots reduced to 22+8 (vs 34+11). These keep memory under control while
preserving the core Moria experience.

### 3. Tiered Data Loading

Creature and item data is divided into depth tiers loaded from disk. Only 2
adjacent tiers are resident at once. Loading happens only on tier boundary
crossings (every 5–10 dungeon levels), not on every level change. Most level
transitions require zero disk I/O.

**Disk speed reality:** Standard 1541 KERNAL LOAD runs at ~300 bytes/sec. A
full tier change (creature tier ~3,600 bytes + item tier ~4,000 bytes + recall
save ~1,200 bytes + recall load ~1,200 bytes) totals ~10 KB, which would take
~33 seconds stock. This is unacceptable. **A fastloader is required
infrastructure, not optional.** With a fastloader (~3–5 KB/sec), a full tier
change takes ~2–3 seconds — acceptable given it only happens at tier boundaries.
Tier change sequence: (1) save current recall to `recall_tN.bin`, (2) load
new creature tier, (3) load new item tier, (4) load new recall from
`recall_tN.bin` (if exists; else zero-init). See Design Decision #11.

The fastloader (`fastload.s`) should be implemented in Phase 4 alongside
`data_loader.s`. A host-side-only optimization of the standard Commodore
serial protocol is sufficient for ~2x speedup (tighter CIA bit timing,
optimized handshake loops). For ~3–5x, a minimal custom protocol with a
small drive-side routine uploaded to the 1541's RAM on startup is needed.
Start with host-side-only; upgrade to drive-side if 2x is not fast enough.
Note: custom drive code may not work with all drive types (SD2IEC, Pi1541);
test compatibility or provide a KERNAL LOAD fallback.

### 4. Simplified Haggling

The multi-round bidding system is replaced with a simple accept/decline at a
calculated price. This avoids the heavy text UI of the original and fits the
C64's tighter display constraints.

### 5. Reduced Spell Count

31 mage spells + 31 priest prayers → 16 + 16 = 32 total. Focus on the most
impactful and iconic spells. Cuts code size and spell table data in half.

### 6. 40-Column Layout

```
+--------------------------------------+
|Message line                          | Row 0
+--------------------------------------+
|                                      | Row 1
|                                      |
|          Game viewport               | Rows 1-20
|          (38 x 20 tiles)             | (38 cols visible)
|                                      |
|                                      | Row 20

+--------------------------------------+
| Border column 0 and 39 reserved      |
+--------------------------------------+
```

### 7. Unshifted Character Set (Uppercase + Graphics)

The C64 has two character sets: unshifted (uppercase + box-drawing graphics) and
shifted (lowercase + uppercase, fewer graphics). These are mutually exclusive —
you cannot display lowercase letters and box-drawing wall characters at the same
time. The game uses **unshifted mode** to get box-drawing characters for walls.
All text (messages, names, menus) is uppercase only. This matches the retro
aesthetic and is standard for C64 games. No custom character set is loaded.

### 8. Color Palette

The C64's 16 colors are used to improve map readability via color RAM ($D800+).
The palette is defined in `color.s`:
- Walls: light grey — structural, background
- Floor: dark grey — recedes visually
- Doors: brown — interactive, stands out from walls
- Stairs: white — high importance navigation
- Player `@`: white — always visible
- Gold/stores: yellow — items of interest
- Monsters: color-coded by threat (green = low, yellow = moderate, red = high,
  relative to player level)
- Unlit/unknown tiles: black (not rendered)

### 9. Variable Monster Speed

Monster speed is preserved from the original — it is a core tactical mechanic.
Each creature type has a speed value: 0 = slow (moves every other player turn),
1 = normal (1:1 with player), 2 = fast (moves twice per player turn). The turn
sequencer (`turn.s`) manages speed counters. This adds minimal memory (1 byte
per creature template, 1 byte per active monster for the counter) but preserves
the important distinction between dangerous fast creatures and manageable slow
ones.

### 10. Sound Effects

Minimal SID sound effects provide gameplay feedback without music:
- Wall bump, melee hit, melee miss, item pickup, level-up, player death
- Simple waveform + ADSR envelope per effect, stateless (fire and forget)
- No background music — preserves the quiet tension of dungeon crawling

### 11. Cumulative Monster Recall

Monster recall accumulates permanently across the entire game, matching
original Moria behavior. Because only the current tier pair's recall fits in
memory (1,200 bytes), recall for other tiers is persisted to individual disk
files (`recall_t0.bin` through `recall_t4.bin`) on tier change. This adds a
small amount of disk I/O to tier transitions (~1,200 bytes written + ~1,200
bytes read = ~1 second with fastloader) but preserves a key game feature:
knowledge gained about monsters is never lost. On a new game, these files do
not exist and recall initializes to zero. On game save, the current tier's
recall is included in the save file; on game load, it is restored to memory.
The per-tier recall files are separate from the save file and persist
independently (they are NOT deleted on death — this is intentional, as a
quality-of-life concession: recall knowledge carries across characters, same
as original Moria).

---

## Build System

**Kick Assembler** is invoked from the command line:

```bash
# Assemble
java -jar KickAss.jar main.s -o moria.prg

# Run tests (assemble test file, run in VICE headless with monitor script)
java -jar KickAss.jar tests/test_rng.s -o tests/test_rng.prg
x64sc -console -nativemonitor -autostartprgmode 1 \
  -autostart tests/test_rng.prg \
  -moncommands tests/test_rng.mon \
  -limitcycles 10000000 2>&1 | grep "^>C:"

# Run in VICE
x64sc moria.prg
```

The `main.s` file uses `#import` directives to include all module files.
Data files (`.bin`) are included with `.import binary` directives and can be
generated by helper scripts or assembled separately.

---

## Testing Strategy

Testing uses two complementary approaches:

**1. Assembly-time `.assert` directives** — Kick Assembler's built-in assertions
validate constants, table sizes, macros, and compile-time expressions during
assembly. These run as part of the normal build with zero overhead.

```asm
.assert "tile type count", TILE_TYPE_COUNT, 16
.assert "map size", MAP_COLS * MAP_ROWS, 3840
```

**2. Runtime tests via VICE headless** — Test programs are assembled to `.prg`,
run in VICE with `-console -nativemonitor`, and results are verified by dumping
memory at a known address after a BRK breakpoint triggers. Each test file has a
corresponding `.mon` monitor script that sets breakpoints and dumps results.

```
tests/
├── test_rng.s          RNG distribution, range bounds
├── test_rng.mon        VICE monitor script for test_rng
├── test_math.s         Multiply, divide, dice roll edge cases
├── test_math.mon
├── test_memory.s       Bank switching read/write verification
├── test_player.s       Stat get/set, bonus lookups, level-up
├── test_dungeon.s      Room placement, connectivity, door placement
├── test_combat.s       Hit/miss, damage ranges, XP awards
├── test_inventory.s    Add/remove/stack, capacity limits
├── test_los.s          Visibility calculations
└── ...
```

Runtime test convention: tests write a result byte to `$02` ($01 = all pass,
$00 = fail) and individual pass/fail flags to `$0400`+ (screen RAM), then
execute BRK. The `.mon` script sets a breakpoint at the BRK address, dumps
`$02` and the result area, and quits. A shell script parses the output for
pass/fail.

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Dungeon generation too slow on 6502 | Player waits >5s on level change | Pre-compute room positions in table, minimize random calls, generate during stairs transition animation |
| Memory overrun | Crashes, corruption | Track allocation in spreadsheet, test with VICE memory monitor, enforce byte-level budgets for banked regions |
| Disk loading too slow on 1541 | Frustrating delays (33 sec stock for full tier change) | Fastloader is **required** (see Design Decision #3). With fastloader (~3–5 KB/sec), tier changes take 2–3 sec. Minimize tier transitions via tier pair caching. Provide KERNAL LOAD fallback for drive compatibility (slower but functional). |
| Game too hard without full spell set | Poor balance | Playtesting pass in Phase 9, adjust creature stats |
| PETSCII map unreadable | Poor UX | Iterate on tile characters, test on real hardware or accurate emulator, use color coding to differentiate elements |
| Runtime test flakiness | VICE cycle count too low/high for reliable BRK trigger | Tune `-limitcycles` per test, add fallback timeout. Use `.assert` for anything testable at assembly time. |
| Stack overflow from deep call nesting | Crash, corruption | 6502 stack is 256 bytes ($0100–$01FF). Deep chains (main→input→move→combat→effects→message→scroll) consume 3-6 bytes per level. Use flat state machine for monster AI loop (32 monsters per turn). Profile stack high-water mark in VICE. Target max 20 nesting levels. |
| ZP clobbered by KERNAL calls | Corrupted game state | Document KERNAL-volatile ZP locations in zeropage.s. Caller-save volatile ZP before KERNAL LOAD/SAVE/OPEN calls in data_loader.s and save.s. |
| Save file write speed on 1541 | 10+ second save delay at stock speed | Expect 3–5 KB save file. Stock 1541 writes at ~300 bytes/sec (10–17 sec). With fastloader write support, 2–4 sec. RLE compress map data. Warn player before save ("SAVING..."). Acceptable delay for infrequent operation. |

---

## Audit Review — Phases 1–3 Implementation

Code review performed against this plan after Phases 1–3 were implemented.
Findings are categorized as bugs, plan deviations, and minor issues.

### Bugs

| # | Severity | File | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | High | `screen.s:91-96` | **`screen_clear` writes 24 bytes past screen RAM.** The second fill loop (`SCREEN_RAM + $300 + x` starting at `x=$E8`) writes to $07E8–$07FF, which is past the end of screen RAM ($07E7). The first loop already covers all 1000 bytes via the `$2E8` offset. The second loop is both redundant and out-of-bounds. Same issue exists for the color RAM fill. Fix: delete the second loop entirely. |
| A2 | High | `dungeon_gen.s:45-46` | **Flag bit assignment swapped vs. plan.** Code defines `FLAG_HAS_ITEM=$01` (bit 0) and `FLAG_OCCUPIED=$02` (bit 1). Plan specifies bit 0 = creature, bit 1 = treasure. No runtime impact in Phase 3 (flags not checked yet), but Phase 5 (monsters) and Phase 6 (items) will read the wrong bits. Fix: either swap the constants in code or update this plan to match the code. |
| A3 | Medium | `input.s:85-96` | **Numeric prefix parsing is broken.** `input_get_command` detects `CMD_REPEAT` but discards the digit value and loops back to `!get_key` without accumulating anything. Comment says "TODO: implement in Phase 3" but Phase 3 is complete. Plan 1.6 lists this as a Phase 1 deliverable. Fix: implement digit accumulation or remove the feature from Phase 1 scope and defer explicitly. |
| A4 | Low | `player_create.s:706` | **"CHOOSE (A-" prompt is incomplete.** The string `create_choose_str` ends with `A-` and a null terminator — the closing range letter and `)` are never appended. Displays as `CHOOSE (A-` for both race and class selection. Fix: dynamically append the final letter and closing paren after the string, or use separate prompt strings per screen. |
| A5 | Medium | `player.s` (player_calc_stats) | **Stat modifiers may be clamped prematurely between race and class additions.** If the intermediate result after adding the race modifier is clamped to 3–18 before the class modifier is added, edge cases produce wrong results. Example: base=17, race=+3, class=-3 → sequential clamping gives 15 (17→20→18→15) instead of correct 17 (17+3-3=17). Current tests use base=10 and don't hit this case. Fix: sum all modifiers first, then clamp once. |
| A6 | High | `dungeon_render.s` / `main.s` | **Full viewport redraw on every move causes visible input lag.** `render_viewport` redraws all 760 tiles (38x20) on every movement keypress, even though typically only 2 tiles changed (old and new player position). Per-tile cost is ~80-120 cycles (map read, flag check, 4x LSR, two table lookups, player position check, `check_store_door` JSR with 6-entry linear scan, screen+color RAM writes), totaling 60,000-90,000 cycles (~3-5 frames). Fix: implement dirty tile rendering — only update changed tiles on move; reserve full redraw for viewport scroll and screen transitions. |
| A7 | High | `input.s` / `main.s` | **Keyboard buffer not flushed before input poll causes key stacking.** While `render_viewport` runs for 3-5 frames, the KERNAL IRQ continues scanning the keyboard and queuing keypresses into the buffer at `$0277` (count at `$C6`). When `input_get_command` calls GETIN, it immediately dequeues stale buffered keys, triggering another full redraw, which buffers more keys — a snowball effect. Fix: flush the keyboard buffer (`lda #0 / sta $c6`) before polling for input. |

### Plan Deviations

| # | Area | Plan Says | Code Does | Resolution Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Character creation order (2.3) | Race → class → stats → name | Race → stats → class → name | Decide: update plan or reorder code. Current order means stat rolling screen shows race-adjusted stats but not class-adjusted stats. |
| D2 | Movement keys (3.3) | Vi-keys + number keys 1–9 (numpad) | Vi-keys + cursor keys only | Add numpad mapping to `key_map_petscii`/`key_map_cmd` tables, or defer numpad to Phase 10 (C128 enhancements) and update plan. |
| D3 | Store building size (3.1) | 6 stores, 4x3 each | 6 stores, 10x5 each (`STORE_W=10, STORE_H=5`) | The 10x5 stores are more proportional on the 80x48 map. Update plan to match code if intentional. |
| D4 | Turn sequencer usage (1.9) | `turn.s` drives the game loop | `main.s` dispatches commands directly, calls `turn_post_action` | `turn_execute` and its phase structure are dead code. Either refactor main loop to use the sequencer or simplify `turn.s` to match actual usage. |
| D5 | Food timer | Not specified in plan | Starting food = 200, hungry at 150 = only 50 turns before hunger warning | Original Moria food lasts thousands of turns. 50 turns is extremely aggressive. Either increase starting food significantly (e.g., 2000+) or adjust thresholds. |

### Minor Issues

| # | File | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | `player_create.s:653-656` | Dead code: `create_init_character` sets player position to (20,12), but `town_generate` (called after in `main.s`) overwrites it to (39,24). Remove the dead assignment. |
| M2 | `tests/*.s` | No `.mon` monitor scripts exist. The testing strategy section of this plan says each test `.s` file has a corresponding `.mon` script for VICE headless execution. The 4 test files cannot run as specified without these scripts. |
| M3 | `tests/test_memory.s` | Does not track overall pass/fail in `$02` like the other test files do. Convention requires `$02 = $01` for all-pass, `$02 = $00` for any-fail. |
| M4 | `screen.s:83-89` | The first fill loop in `screen_clear` has a 24-byte overlap: `SCREEN_RAM+$200` writes $0600–$06FF, and `SCREEN_RAM+$2E8` writes $06E8–$07E7, overlapping at $06E8–$06FF. Harmless but wasteful. Could restructure as 3 full pages + a partial 232-byte fill. |

### Status

- **Phases 1–3 implemented and audited:** 21 source files, 4 test files

**Bug fixes applied:**

| # | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Fixed** | `screen_clear` rewritten: 3 full pages + 232-byte partial fill. No overlap, no OOB write. |
| A2 | **Fixed** | Flag bits swapped to match plan: `FLAG_OCCUPIED=$01` (bit 0), `FLAG_HAS_ITEM=$02` (bit 1). Header comment in `dungeon_gen.s:16-17` also updated to match. |
| A3 | **Fixed** | Broken `CMD_REPEAT` handling removed. Numeric prefix explicitly deferred to Phase 6+. `input_get_command` now skips unknown keys cleanly. Dead `CMD_REPEAT` constant and stale header comment cleaned up. |
| A4 | **Fixed** | Added `put_choose_suffix` helper. Race prompt now shows "CHOOSE (A-H)", class prompt shows "CHOOSE (A-X)" with correct final letter. |
| A5 | **Not a bug** | Code already sums both modifiers before clamping — no intermediate clamp exists. Added clarifying comment documenting the valid range (sum -8 to 28, no 8-bit wrap). |
| A6 | **Fixed** | Implemented dirty tile rendering: on player move without viewport scroll, only old and new player tiles are redrawn. Full viewport redraw reserved for scroll, screen transitions, and initial render. |
| A7 | **Fixed** | Keyboard buffer flushed (`sta $c6`) before input polling in `input_get_command`. |

**Plan deviation resolutions:**

| # | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Plan updated** | Creation order is race → stats → class → name. This lets the stat roll screen show race-adjusted previews, and the class screen filters by race. Intentional. |
| D2 | **Deferred** | Numpad mapping deferred to Phase 10 (C128 enhancements). Cursor keys + vi-keys sufficient for C64. |
| D3 | **Plan updated** | Stores are 10x5 tiles, intentional for 80x48 map proportions. Plan section 3.1 should read "10x5 each". |
| D4 | **Fixed** | Removed dead `turn_execute` and phase constants from `turn.s`. Module now provides `turn_post_action` (called by main loop) plus tick subroutines. Dead ZP allocations `zp_turn_phase` ($42) and `zp_turn_state` ($4F) reclaimed as spare slots in `zeropage.s`. |
| D5 | **Fixed** | Starting food increased from 200 to 2000 turns. Hunger thresholds unchanged (hungry at 150, weak at 50, faint at 10). |

**Minor issue resolutions:**

| # | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | **Fixed** | Removed dead position assignment (20,12) from `create_init_character`. Position set by `town_generate`. |
| M2 | **Deferred** | `.mon` scripts for VICE headless tests deferred — manual VICE testing used for now. |
| M3 | **Deferred** | `test_memory.s` pass/fail convention fix deferred to test infrastructure pass. |
| M4 | **Fixed** | Addressed with A1 — `screen_clear` no longer has overlap or OOB writes. |

### Stat Generation Deep Dive (QA Review)

Investigation into why character rolling never produces stats above 16, even for
races with large positive modifiers (e.g., Half-Troll STR +4, Elf INT +2).

**Finding S1 — Wrong dice algorithm (HIGH)**

| Aspect | Umoria (correct) | Before fix | After fix |
|--------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| Dice pool | 18 dice cycling d3, d4, d5 | 6 independent `math_dice(3,6,0)` calls | d3+d4+d5 per stat |
| Per-stat formula | 5 + three consecutive dice (one d3 + one d4 + one d5) | 3d6 | 5 + d3 + d4 + d5 (range 8–17) |
| Raw stat range | 8–17 | 3–18 | 8–17 |
| Total constraint | Re-roll all 18 dice if sum < 43 or sum > 54 | None | Re-roll if total not in 73–84 |
| Distribution shape | Tight, correlated across stats (total constrained) | Independent, wide variance per stat | Constrained, tight distribution |

**Status: FIXED.** Dice algorithm rewritten in `player_create.s`.

**Finding S2 — Wrong race/class modifier application (CRITICAL)**

This is the root cause of the user-reported defect.

Umoria does NOT use simple addition for modifiers. Each +1 or −1 is applied as a
separate call to `incrementStat()` / `decrementStat()`:

```
incrementStat(stat):
    if stat < 18:       stat += 1
    if stat 18–87:      stat += randomNumber(15) + 5   // adds 6–20
    if stat 88–107:     stat += randomNumber(6) + 2    // adds 3–8
    if stat > 107:      stat += 1

decrementStat(stat):
    if stat > 108:      stat -= 1
    if stat 88–108:     stat -= randomNumber(6) + 2
    if stat 19–88:      stat -= randomNumber(15) + 5
    if stat > 18:       stat = 18
    if stat > 3:        stat -= 1
```

Internal encoding: values 3–18 stored as-is; 19–118 = 18/01 through 18/100.

**Example**: Half-Troll STR modifier +4, base STR 16:
- Umoria: 16 → 17 → 18 → 18/(06–20) → 18/(12–40). Easily reaches 18/30+.
- Old code: `min(16 + 4, 18) = 18`. Could never reach 18/xx.

**Example**: Elf INT modifier +2, base INT 17:
- Umoria: 17 → 18 → 18/(06–20). Reaches 18/06–18/20.
- Old code: `min(17 + 2, 18) = 18`.

**Status: FIXED.** `increment_stat`/`decrement_stat` implemented in `player.s` with
umoria's exact randomized step logic. `apply_modifier` loops through each ±1.
`player_calc_stats` and `create_calc_modified_stat` both use the new system.

**Finding S3 — 18/xx support too limited (HIGH)**

`tables.s` line 7 says: *"For C64 simplicity, we cap stats at 18 (no 18/xx
percentile stats)."* This conflicts with faithful umoria behavior:

| Aspect | Umoria | Before fix | After fix |
|--------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Stats that support 18/xx | All six (STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, CHR) | STR only (via `PL_STR_EXTRA`) | All six stats |
| How 18/xx is reached | Race/class modifiers via incrementStat | Only if base die roll is exactly 18 | Via increment_stat during modifier application |
| Player struct fields | Single uint8_t per stat (3–118 encoding) | Separate base + extra byte (STR only) | Single byte per stat (3–118 encoding) |
| Display support | All stats show 18/xx | Only STR shows 18/xx (`ui_character.s`) | All stats via `put_stat_val` |

**Status: FIXED.** `PL_STR_EXTRA` removed (now `PL_SPARE_63`). Single-byte encoding
(3–118) for all stats. `put_stat_val` simplified to take A only (no Y param).
`ui_character.s` updated. `stat_bonus_index` caps at index 15 for 18/xx stats.

**Finding S4 — PRNG algorithm is acceptable (OK)**

The 32-bit Galois LFSR (polynomial $ED, period 2^32−1) with rejection sampling
in `rng_range` is adequate for game use. CIA timer seeding provides reasonable
initial entropy. No changes needed.

**Required code changes (all resolved):**

| # | Change | Status |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Replace 3d6 with umoria's constrained multi-die system | **Fixed** — `player_create.s` rolls d3+d4+d5 per stat (+5), total constrained 73–84 |
| 2 | Implement `increment_stat` / `decrement_stat` | **Fixed** — Added to `player.s` with umoria's randomized step logic |
| 3 | Extend 18/xx support to all six stats | **Fixed** — Single-byte encoding (3–118), `PL_STR_EXTRA` removed, `ui_character.s` + `put_stat_val` updated |
| 4 | Remove "cap at 18" constraint from `tables.s` | **Fixed** — Header comment updated |
| 5 | Update plan Phase 2.3 | **Fixed** — Phase 2.3 now describes correct umoria algorithm |

### Dungeon Generation Deep Dive (QA Review)

Investigation of persistent dungeon generation bugs including rooms with no exits,
incorrect algorithm vs. umoria, build breakage, and zero test coverage. Compared
against actual umoria source (`src/dungeon_generate.cpp`, `src/dungeon_tile.h`,
`src/config.cpp`).

#### Finding DG1 — Build is broken (BLOCKER)

`dungeon_gen.s` references three undefined symbols:
- `trap_count` (lines 99, 404) — not allocated anywhere
- `place_traps` (line 418) — subroutine doesn't exist
- `place_secrets` (line 419) — subroutine doesn't exist

These are forward references to Phase 4.2 features. The code cannot assemble.
Must be stubbed out to restore a buildable state.

#### Finding DG2 — Connectivity algorithm is fundamentally wrong (CRITICAL)

**The reported bug** (rooms with no exits) traces directly to the corridor
connection algorithm. The current code connects consecutive rooms (room 0→1,
1→2, 2→3, etc.) in the order they were placed. This is a **linear chain**
that does NOT guarantee all rooms are reachable if any corridor fails to connect.

**Umoria's approach:**
1. Place rooms into a 6x6 grid (typically 24-28 rooms)
2. **Randomly shuffle** the room location list
3. Connect room[0]→room[1]→...→room[N]→room[0] as a **circular chain**
   (Hamiltonian cycle), guaranteeing every room has at least 2 connections
4. The tunnel algorithm uses a biased random walk toward the destination with
   up to 2000 iterations, ensuring it reaches the target even through winding
   paths

**Current code issues:**
- Only 4-8 rooms (vs. umoria's ~24-28) — fewer rooms means longer corridors
  between non-adjacent rooms, increasing failure risk
- Rooms are connected in placement order, not shuffled — rooms placed far apart
  in the grid may have extremely long tunnel distances
- No circular chain — room 0 has only 1 connection (to room 1), making it
  vulnerable to disconnection
- L-shaped corridors (fixed 2-segment paths) can fail if the path crosses
  multiple rooms — the corridor carver stops at the first perpendicular wall
  it hits and places a door, but the corridor segment terminates without
  reaching the target room's interior
- The current algorithm has NO concept of reaching the destination — it just
  carves to the target coordinate. If another room's wall is in the way, the
  corridor dead-ends at a door in that room's wall, leaving the intended
  destination room disconnected

**Root cause of the screenshot bug:** When connecting rooms A and B with an
L-shaped corridor, if room C sits between them, the horizontal segment hits
C's vertical wall and places a door there. The corridor segment ends at room B's
x-coordinate but that coordinate is inside room C, not room B. Room B gets
no connecting corridor.

#### Finding DG3 — Room placement algorithm differs from umoria (HIGH)

| Aspect | Umoria | Current code |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Grid system | 6x6 grid of slots, ~32 attempts → ~24-28 rooms | No grid; random placement with overlap rejection |
| Room count | Mean 32 attempts into 36 slots | 4-8 rooms (rng(5)+4) |
| Room sizing | Width: 2-22 interior, Height: 2-7 interior | Width: 4-11, Height: 3-7 |
| Room types | Normal, overlapping rectangles, inner rooms, cross-shaped | Basic rectangle only |
| Unusual rooms | Level/300 chance per room | None |
| Level dimensions | 66x198 | 80x48 |

The 80x48 map with 4-8 rooms is a reasonable C64 simplification, but the room
count is too low and the placement algorithm creates pathological layouts where
rooms cluster or spread too far apart.

#### Finding DG4 — Tunnel algorithm differs from umoria (HIGH)

| Aspect | Umoria | Current code |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Path finding | Biased random walk toward target, 2000 iteration limit | Fixed L-shaped (2-segment) path |
| Direction changes | 70% chance to redirect toward target, 1/9 random | None — always horizontal then vertical or vice versa |
| Wall penetration | Marks adjacent granite as TMP2_WALL to prevent clustered entries | No tracking — can place multiple doors in adjacent wall tiles |
| Room wall handling | Records wall crossings for later door placement | Inline door placement during carving |
| Robustness | 2000-iteration walk guarantees reaching target even through complex geometry | Can dead-end when another room blocks the L-path |

#### Finding DG5 — Door placement differs from umoria (MEDIUM)

| Aspect | Umoria | Current code |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Room entry doors | 25% chance at tunnel-granite intersection; rest become corridor floor | Always places closed door on perpendicular room wall |
| Corridor intersection doors | Placed at tunnel-corridor crossings (15% chance) after all tunnels | Not implemented |
| Door types | 1/3 open (3/4 normal, 1/4 broken), 1/3 closed (plain/stuck/locked), 1/3 secret | Always closed |
| Wall detection | Uses FLAG_LIT to distinguish room walls from rock | Same — correct |

#### Finding DG6 — Streamer generation order is wrong (MEDIUM)

Current code comment says: *"Streamers BEFORE corridors ensures corridors
always overwrite mineral veins they cross."* The actual call order is:

```
place_streamers     // line 413 — BEFORE connect_rooms
connect_rooms       // line 415 — after streamers
```

But umoria does it the opposite way:
1. Build tunnels (corridors)
2. Fill empty space with TILE_GRANITE_WALL
3. **Then** place streamers

Umoria places streamers AFTER tunnels and granite fill, which means streamers
can overwrite corridor floor tiles (creating obstacles). The current code places
streamers before tunnels, so corridor carving will overwrite streamer tiles —
meaning streamers never create obstacles in corridors. This is actually more
player-friendly but differs from umoria.

Additionally, umoria places 3 magma + 2 quartz streamers (5 total). Current
code places 1 + 50% chance of a second (1-2 total).

#### Finding DG7 — Stairs placement differences (MEDIUM)

| Aspect | Umoria | Current code |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Down stairs count | 3-4 (randomNumber(2)+2) | 2 |
| Up stairs count | 1-2 (randomNumber(2)) | 1 |
| Placement criteria | Random floor tile with >= 3 adjacent walls (degrades) | Random floor tile in specified room |
| Wall adjacency check | Yes — prefers corner-like positions | No — any interior floor tile |

#### Finding DG8 — fill_map_rock uses wrong fill tile (LOW)

`fill_map_rock` fills with `TILE_WALL_H` ($10, "horizontal wall"). Umoria
fills with `TILE_NULL_WALL` (0), then converts to `TILE_GRANITE_WALL` (12) after
tunnels are carved. The current code uses a concrete wall type for uncarved rock,
which means:

1. The corridor carver's LIT-flag check (`and #FLAG_LIT / beq = rock`) works
   correctly because unlit TILE_WALL_H distinguishes rock from room walls
2. But all 6 wall types ($10-$60) share the same "is this a wall?" semantic,
   which is fragile — the code relies on the LIT bit rather than tile type
   to distinguish rock from structure

Umoria uses the type value itself (>= MIN_CAVE_WALL=12) to identify walls vs.
open space. A dedicated "rock" tile type would be cleaner but the current
approach works.

#### Finding DG9 — DUNGEON_FLAGS marks all rooms as lit+visited (LOW) — RESOLVED

Originally `DUNGEON_FLAGS = FLAG_LIT | FLAG_VISITED` ($0C), baking full
visibility into every tile at generation time. **Fixed in Phase 4.5:**

- `DUNGEON_FLAGS = FLAG_LIT` ($08) — rooms start lit but NOT visited
- Corridors start with NO flags (invisible until the player's torch reveals them)
- `dungeon_los.s` implements three-state visibility: unseen → visible → remembered
- `darken_rooms` strips FLAG_LIT from dark rooms (umoria formula: lit if dlvl <= rng(25)+1)
- `update_visibility` sets FLAG_VISITED via torch radius (Phase A) and room reveal (Phase B)
- Rendering dims remembered tiles (FLAG_VISITED but outside torch and not FLAG_LIT) to dark grey

#### Finding DG10 — Zero test coverage for dungeon generation (HIGH)

No `test_dungeon.s` exists. Dungeon generation is the most algorithmically
complex part of the codebase and has the most edge cases. The following tests
are needed:

**Room placement tests:**
- `check_room_overlap` returns correct results for overlapping and non-overlapping rooms
- `check_room_overlap` handles ROOM_GAP correctly
- Rooms never placed outside map boundary (x >= 4, y >= 4, x+w <= 76, y+h <= 44)
- `draw_dungeon_room` writes correct wall/floor tiles and flags
- Room count never drops below 2 after retry exhaustion

**Corridor tests:**
- `carve_h_corridor` carves floor from cx1 to cx2 (both directions)
- `carve_v_corridor` carves floor from cy1 to cy2 (both directions)
- Corridor through room wall places door (not floor)
- Corridor through rock places floor (not door)
- Single-tile corridor (cx1 == cx2) handled correctly
- L-shaped corridor reaches both endpoints

**Connectivity tests:**
- Every room has at least one floor tile adjacent to a corridor or door
- Player start position is on a walkable tile
- All stairs are on walkable tiles
- Pathfinding from player start to each staircase succeeds (BFS/flood-fill)

**Streamer tests:**
- Streamers don't overwrite room floor tiles
- Streamers don't overwrite doors or stairs
- Streamer bounds checking works (doesn't write outside map)

**Stairs tests:**
- `verify_stairs` re-places overwritten stairs
- Stairs placed inside room interiors (not on walls)
- Up-stairs and down-stairs in different rooms

**Integration test:**
- Generate 100+ dungeons, verify all pass connectivity flood-fill
- No room is fully enclosed (every room reachable from player start)

#### Summary of required changes

| # | Priority | Change | Status |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | BLOCKER | Stub out `trap_count`, `place_traps`, `place_secrets` to restore buildability | **Fixed** — `dungeon_features.s` implements traps and secrets |
| 2 | CRITICAL | Rewrite connectivity algorithm: shuffle rooms, connect as circular chain | **Fixed** — Fisher-Yates shuffle + circular chain in `connect_rooms` |
| 3 | HIGH | Add flood-fill connectivity verification after generation; re-generate if unreachable | **Fixed** — BFS `verify_connectivity` with max 10 retries |
| 4 | HIGH | Create `test_dungeon.s` with room placement, corridor, and connectivity tests | **Fixed** — 23 runtime tests covering rooms, corridors, connectivity, doors, visibility, dark rooms |
| 5 | MEDIUM | Add door type variety (open/closed/secret per umoria probabilities) | **Fixed** — 50/50 open/closed at junctions; `place_secrets` deferred to post-search-UX |
| 6 | MEDIUM | Increase streamer count to match umoria (3 magma + 2 quartz) | **Fixed** — 5 streamers (3 magma + 2 quartz) |
| 7 | MEDIUM | Add wall-adjacency check for stairs placement | **Fixed** — `random_wall_adj_floor` with degrading threshold (>=3, >=2, >=1, any) |
| 8 | LOW | Consider increasing room count range (e.g., 6-12) for better dungeon density | Deferred |
| 9 | LOW | Add dark room support (defer LIT flag to Phase 4.5 LOS implementation) | **Fixed** — `room_lit[]` array, `darken_rooms` post-processing, umoria formula |

**Additional fixes applied during QA:**

| # | Issue | Resolution |
|---|-------|------------|
| DG-A | Corridors adjacent to rooms without doors | **Fixed** — `add_corridor_doors` iterates per-room-wall (max 1 door per wall side) |
| DG-B | Secret doors at corridor junctions block passage | **Fixed** — `random_door_type` produces only open/closed; `place_secrets` deferred |
| DG-C | Room overlap detection off-by-one | **Fixed** — `check_room_overlap` uses ROOM_GAP correctly |

---

## Known Bugs

Open issues observed during playtesting. Not yet assigned to a review pass.

| # | Severity | Description | Notes |
|---|----------|-------------|-------|
| BUG-1 | **HIGH** | Any 18 stat turns into 18/99 (or close) after class selection — suspiciously high every time | Likely a bug in stat adjustment or the 18/xx exceptional strength roll. Should only apply to STR, and the xx value should be random 1-100, not always near max. Investigate `player_create.s` race/class stat adjustments and the 18/xx logic. |
| BUG-2 | **MEDIUM** | Stats display screen does not match umoria's stat screen layout (status bars at bottom) | Compare `ui_status.s` / `ui_character.s` rendering against umoria's `io.cpp` display format. The bottom status bars should show: name, race, class, level on one line; STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, CHR stats; then HP, MP, AC, XP, dungeon level, gold. |
| BUG-3 | **MEDIUM** | Town has no townspeople (rogues, fighters, drunks, etc.) | umoria spawns 4-8 townspeople as level-0 creatures on dlvl=0. These are harmless/low-threat flavor mobs. Currently `monster_spawn_level` may skip dlvl=0 or no creatures are defined for town level. |
| BUG-4 | **LOW** | Town renders very slowly | Likely full-screen redraw on every frame. Investigate whether dirty-tile optimization is working for the town level, or if the viewport is being fully redrawn each turn. May also be related to the large open space of the town map. |
| BUG-5 | **LOW** | Town shows periods (`.`) inside store walls instead of empty space | The store interior tiles should be floor or empty space, not the dungeon floor character. Check `dungeon_gen.s` town generation — store interiors may be filled with `TILE_FLOOR` (which renders as `.`) instead of `TILE_ROOM_FLOOR` or a blank tile. |

---

## What's Next

Phase 4 status:

| # | What | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.1 | Room-and-corridor dungeon generation | **Complete** — rooms, corridors, doors, streamers, stairs, connectivity verification |
| 4.2 | Dungeon features (doors, traps, stairs) | **Complete** — open/close/stuck doors, 6 trap types, stair transitions, `place_secrets` + `do_search` (1-in-6 reveal) |
| 4.3 | Data loader + fastloader | Not started — needed for tier boundary crossings |
| 4.4 | Viewport scrolling for 80x48 map | **Complete** — dirty tile rendering, panel movement |
| 4.5 | Line of sight (full) | **Complete** — three-state visibility (unseen/visible/remembered), torch radius, room reveal, dark rooms, dimmed rendering |
| 4.6 | Player movement updates | **Complete** — corridor running (8 dirs, 6 stop conditions), trap signaling (carry flag), bump suppression, context-aware secret door rendering |

Phase 5 status (monster/combat):

| # | What | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 5.1 | Monster data structures | **Complete** — 20 creature types (all real umoria creatures), 32 active slots, spawn/find/remove. All stats match umoria (see MC1 resolved). |
| 5.2 | Monster AI | **Complete** — wake/sleep, greedy movement, confused random movement, speed 0/1/2, CF_ATTACK_ONLY flag. All RP7 speed/movement bugs fixed. Poltergeist speed wrong (see RP8-1). |
| 5.3 | Player melee combat | **Complete** — to-hit (class+race BTH), damage, death, XP (integer-only), level-up. Missing critical hits (MC4.1). |
| 5.4 | Monster melee attacks | **Complete** — 2 attack slots, effects (poison/confuse/paralyze/acid/aggravate). AC reduction correctly limited to ATK_NORMAL only. Poison/confusion stacking matches umoria. Paralysis timer slightly short (see RP8-3). |
| 5.5 | Status effects & regen | **Complete** — effect timers tick with expiration messages (poison, blind, confuse, paralyze). HP regen implemented (CON-based counter, poison suppresses, extra-regen doubles rate). Starvation damage (1 HP/turn). Light source charge tracking with dim warning at 10. |
| 5.6 | Monster rendering | **Complete** — FLAG_OCCUPIED check, cr_display/cr_color lookup in viewport renderer. |

**Suggested next steps (priority order):**
1. **Fix RP8-1 — Poltergeist speed** — Should be speed=2 (fast), currently speed=1. Trivial fix.
2. **Fix RP8-2/RP8-3 — Paralysis damage and timer** — Should apply full damage and use +3 timer offset. Low practical impact now (Floating Eye has 0d0 dice) but correct pattern matters for future creatures.
3. **Implement MC4.1 — Critical hits** — Player critical hit system not yet implemented.
4. **Phase 6 — Items and inventory** — Partially implemented, needs review.
5. **Phase 4.3 — Data loader** — can be deferred until more creature tiers are needed.

### Review Pass 5 — Post-Phase 4.5 Full Codebase Review (2026-02-10)

Reviewed all 32 files (~12,400 lines). All tests pass (6/6 suites, 52/52 tests).
No blocking bugs found.

#### Test coverage gaps

| Module | Gap | Severity | Status |
|--------|-----|----------|--------|
| math.s | `math_dice` is completely untested — no tests for bonus handling, negative bonuses, or edge cases | Medium | **Fixed** — Tests 13-16: basic 1d6+0, positive bonus 1d6+10, negative bonus 1d6-1, multi-dice 10d8+0 (20 iterations each) |
| test_dungeon.s Test 14 | Streamer scan only checks 3 of 15 map pages ($C000, $C400, $C800) — streamers in unscanned pages would be missed | Low | **Fixed** — Pointer-based full map scan ($C000-$CEFF, 15 pages) |
| test_memory.s | ZP save/restore only validates 4 of 142 bytes ($02–$05) | Low | **Fixed** — Loop-based test covers all 142 ZP bytes ($02-$8F) using X^$A5 pattern |
| test_rng.s | `rng_range` boundary cases (N=1, N=255) not tested | Low | **Fixed** — Tests 5-6: rng_range(1) always 0, rng_range(255) always <255 (100 iterations each) |

#### Code quality notes (non-blocking)

| File | Issue | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| dungeon_render.s | `render_single_tile` (lines 289–452) duplicates ~150 lines from `render_viewport` — extract shared subroutine when code next changes | Low |
| dungeon_features.s:196 | `find_random_floor` returns last (possibly non-floor) coordinates if 200 attempts exhausted — trap could land on wall tile (extremely rare) | Low |
| dungeon_gen.s:2062 | BFS queue has no overflow guard — safe in practice (max ~2000 passable tiles vs 4000 queue capacity on 80x48 map) | Low |

#### False positives investigated and cleared

Three findings were flagged by automated review and manually verified as correct:

1. **Room lit/dark logic (dungeon_gen.s:621–624):** `ldx`/`lda` between `cmp` and `bcc` do NOT affect the carry flag. Logic correctly implements "lit if dlvl <= threshold".
2. **math_dice negative bonus (math.s:103–110):** Sign-extension via `adc #$ff` on the high byte is the standard 6502 pattern for 16-bit addition of a sign-extended 8-bit negative value. Verified with worked examples.
3. **Corridor swap infinite loop (dungeon_gen.s:1031–1043):** All coordinates are valid map positions (0–79), so the Y register always reaches the target. No wrap-around possible.

---

### Review Pass 6 — Monster/Combat Deep Review vs. umoria (2026-02-11)

Reviewed all Phase 5 implementation (monster.s, combat.s, monster_attack.s, monster_ai.s, turn.s)
against umoria source (data_creatures.cpp, monster.h, monster.cpp, player.cpp).
All 10 test suites pass. Attack types verified by manually decoding umoria's monster_attacks[] array.

#### MC1: Creature stat data — RESOLVED

**Status: FIXED.** All 20 creature types now match umoria. The 5 invented creatures (Fruit bat,
Soldier ant, Green naga hatchling, Cave spider, Wild cat) have been replaced with real umoria
creatures (White Harpy, Green Worm mass, Poltergeist, Huge Brown Bat, Creeping Copper Coins).

All stats verified correct against umoria `data_creatures.cpp`:
- **XP values**: 20/20 match (kill_exp_value)
- **AC values**: 20/20 match
- **HP dice**: 20/20 match (hd_num, hd_sides)
- **Creature levels**: 20/20 match
- **Sleep values**: 20/20 match
- **Awareness radii**: 20/20 match
- **Attack types**: 20/20 match (slot 0 and slot 1)
- **Attack dice**: 20/20 match

**Naming note:** C64 "Grey Mold" = umoria "Grey Mushroom patch" (same stats, display 'm'/M).
C64 "Giant Frog" = umoria "Giant Green Frog" (same stats).

**Multi-attack limitation:** White Harpy has 3 attacks in umoria (claw 1d1, claw 1d1, bite 1d2)
but C64 only supports 2 slots (claw 1d1, claw 1d1). Third attack lost. Low impact (1d2 normal).

#### MC2: XP system bugs — PARTIALLY RESOLVED

1. ~~**Min-1 XP floor not in umoria.**~~ **FIXED** — `combat_award_xp` (combat.s:473) no longer
   forces minimum 1 XP. Weak creatures correctly award 0 XP when player level >> creature level.

2. **No fractional XP accumulation (known simplification).** umoria uses 16-bit fixed-point
   fractions (`exp_fraction`) to preserve partial XP. The C64 uses integer division only.
   This means small XP amounts from weak creatures are lost entirely (0 instead of accumulating
   fractions). Documented in code comment at combat.s:475. Impact is minor for early game
   since creature XP values are high enough relative to player level.

3. **Only uses cr_xp_lo, ignores cr_xp_hi** (combat.s:459). Safe for current creatures
   (max XP=9) but will break when higher-tier creatures are added.

#### MC3: Combat formula bugs — PARTIALLY RESOLVED

1. ~~**Monster to-hit off-by-one.**~~ **FIXED** — `mon_atk_roll_tohit` (monster_attack.s:249-250)
   now uses `cmp zp_player_ac; bcs !mart_hit+` correctly (`>=` check). No extra `beq`.

2. ~~**Player to-hit missing race BTH.**~~ **FIXED** — `combat_calc_tohit` (combat.s:172-197)
   now adds race BTH from `race_properties` offset 7, with signed handling and clamping.

3. **Confusion damage handling still wrong (see RP7-3).** The original finding was inverted:
   the code does NOT apply AC reduction + physical damage. Instead it applies NO damage at all
   (`lda #0; sta zp_combat_dmg`). In umoria, confusion deals FULL dice damage (no AC reduction)
   plus 50% chance of confusion effect. See Review Pass 7 for details.

#### MC4: Missing features — MEDIUM

1. **No critical hit system.** umoria's `playerWeaponCriticalBlow` (chance based on weapon
   weight + to-hit + class_adj × level, damage multiplier 2-5×) is not implemented. All player
   hits do flat damage. Critical chance formula: `(weapon_weight + 5*plus_to_hit +
   class_level_adj[class][BTH]*level) / 5000`. Tiers: 2× (+5), 3× (+10), 4× (+15), 5× (+20).

2. ~~**No HP/MP regeneration.**~~ **HP REGEN IMPLEMENTED** — `turn_tick_regen` (turn.s:210-281)
   implements CON-based regen counter (8-50 turns per 1 HP depending on CON). Poison suppresses
   regen. `zp_eff_regen` doubles tick rate. Simplified vs umoria's 16-bit fixed-point fractional
   accumulation — C64 uses integer counter per CON. Starvation damage (1 HP/turn at food=0)
   also implemented. MP regen not yet needed (spells not implemented).

3. ~~**Missing effect-specific messages.**~~ **VERIFIED CORRECT** — Effect handlers DO print
   messages: `mon_atk_effect_poison` calls `mon_atk_build_effect_msg` (monster_attack.s:408-417),
   `mon_atk_effect_confuse` prints at lines 442-452, `mon_atk_effect_paralyze` prints at
   lines 514-524. Player sees both "THE X HITS YOU." and "THE X POISONS YOU." etc.
   Effect expiration messages also print: "YOU FEEL BETTER." (poison), "YOU CAN SEE AGAIN."
   (blind), "YOU FEEL LESS CONFUSED." (confuse), "YOU CAN MOVE AGAIN." (paralyze).

4. **Monster confusion/stun timers never decremented.** `MX_CONFUSE` and `MX_STUN` fields
   exist in the monster entry struct but no code decrements them per turn or clears MF_CONFUSED
   when the timer expires. (Currently dead code — no way to confuse a monster yet.)

#### MC5: Design simplifications — LOW (speed issues mostly resolved)

1. ~~**Speed model oversimplified.**~~ **MOSTLY FIXED** — Speed model now uses 0=slow (every other
   turn), 1=normal, 2=fast (double move). CF_ATTACK_ONLY flag separates "can't move" from "slow".
   Three slow creatures correctly at speed=0. Remaining issue: Poltergeist speed=1 should be 2
   (see RP8-1). Huge Brown Bat correctly at speed=2. Very fast creatures (umoria speed=13) capped
   at 2 moves instead of 3 — acceptable simplification for C64.

2. **Blows table simplified.** C64 uses 5×4 (5 weight classes, 4 DEX brackets). umoria uses
   7×6 (7 weight classes, 6 DEX brackets including 18/xx ranges). Fine for now since weapons
   and 18/xx DEX aren't in play yet.

3. ~~**Stale header comment in monster_ai.s:8.**~~ **FIXED** — Header now correctly documents
   CF_ATTACK_ONLY behavior and updated speed model.

#### Verified correct

1. **Attack type constants** (ATK_NORMAL=1, ATK_CONFUSE=3, ATK_ACID=6, ATK_PARALYZE=11,
   ATK_POISON=14, ATK_AGGRAVATE=20) match umoria's numbering.
2. **Base to-hit values per attack type** in `mon_atk_base_tohit` table match umoria's
   `playerTestAttackHits` switch statement.
3. **Monster to-hit formula** (`base_tohit + creature_level × 3`) correctly derives from
   umoria's `playerTestBeingHit(base, level, 0, AC, CLASS_MISC_HIT)` with CLASS_MISC_HIT=3.
4. **AC damage reduction formula** (`damage -= (AC × damage) / 200`) matches umoria exactly.
5. **Player to-hit roll** (combat.s:332-360) correctly compensates for rng_range's [0,N-1]
   range vs umoria's [1,N] by using `>=` instead of `>`.
6. **Monster to-hit roll** (monster_attack.s:229-257) also correctly uses `>=` check.
7. **Paralysis saving throw** logic (monster_attack.s:447-504) correctly implements
   class_save_base + player_level with rng_range(100) check. (Simplified vs umoria's
   full formula that includes WIS adjustment — acceptable simplification.)
8. **Monster rendering** is implemented in dungeon_render.s (checks FLAG_OCCUPIED, looks up
   cr_display/cr_color).
9. **Player to-hit formula** (combat.s:161-250) now correctly includes class BTH + race BTH +
   PL_TOHIT × 3 + player_level × class_bth_per_level, matching umoria's full calculation.
10. **All 20 creature stats** match umoria source (XP, AC, HP dice, levels, sleep, aaf, attack
    types, attack dice). Verified against `data_creatures.cpp` and `monster_attacks[]` array.
11. **Effect messages** are printed: poison, confusion, and paralysis handlers all call
    `mon_atk_build_effect_msg` with the appropriate strings.
12. **XP award formula** (`cr_xp * cr_level / player_level`) correctly matches umoria.
    Min-1 floor removed. Integer-only is a documented simplification.

### Review Pass 7 — Verification of Review Pass 6 Findings (2026-02-11)

Cross-referenced Review Pass 6 findings against current code and umoria source (`data_creatures.cpp`,
`monster.cpp`, `player.cpp`, `game_run.cpp`). Found that MC1-MC3 have been substantially fixed in
code but the BUILDPLAN was not updated to reflect this. Additionally found 8 new bugs not identified
in Review Pass 6, mostly in `mon_atk_effect_dispatch` (attack type routing) and the speed model.

All 10 test suites still pass.

#### RP7-1: Speed=0 creatures cannot attack — CRITICAL

Four creatures have `cr_speed` = 0: Shrieker Mushroom (#6), Floating Eye (#8), Grey Mold (#16),
Yellow Mold (#18). In `monster_ai_tick` (monster_ai.s:60-61), speed=0 causes the monster to be
**completely skipped** — no wake check, no attack processing, nothing. These creatures are
decorative scenery that can be killed without any resistance.

In umoria, these creatures have speed=11 (normal) with `CM_ATTACK_ONLY` movement flag — they cannot
move but DO attack when the player is adjacent. The distinction between "can't move" and "can't act"
is missing from the C64's speed model.

**Impact:** Floating Eye never paralyzes (its entire purpose). Shrieker Mushroom never aggravates.
Grey Mold never confuses. Yellow Mold never attacks. These are 4/20 creatures rendered harmless.

**Fix options:**
1. Add `MF_ATTACK_ONLY` flag. In `monster_ai_tick`, process speed=0 monsters with a simplified
   path: wake check → if awake and player adjacent → attack. Skip movement entirely.
2. Set speed=1 and add a `CM_NO_MOVE` flag checked in `monster_move_toward`/`monster_move_random`.
   Simpler: monster wakes, tries to move, flag prevents actual movement, but adjacency check
   in `monster_try_step` still triggers `monster_attack_player`.

Option 2 is simpler to implement — just check a flag before moving and skip movement but still
process the monster normally otherwise.

#### RP7-2: Poison attacks wrongly apply AC reduction — MEDIUM

`mon_atk_effect_dispatch` routes poison (ATK_POISON) through `mon_atk_ac_reduce` before applying
the poison effect (monster_attack.s:341-344):
```
!maed_poison:
    jsr mon_atk_ac_reduce       // WRONG — poison has no AC reduction in umoria
    jsr mon_atk_effect_poison
```

In umoria (monster.cpp:1665-1668), poison attacks call `playerTakesHit(damage, ...)` with the full
dice damage — NO AC reduction. Only attack type 1 (Normal) gets AC reduction.

**Fix:** Remove `jsr mon_atk_ac_reduce` from the poison handler.

#### RP7-3: Confusion attacks deal no damage — MEDIUM

`mon_atk_effect_dispatch` sets confusion damage to 0 (monster_attack.s:346-347):
```
!maed_confuse:
    lda #0
    sta zp_combat_dmg           // Confusion: no physical damage
```

In umoria (monster.cpp:1563-1576), confusion attacks deal **full dice damage** (no AC reduction)
AND have a 50% chance (`randomNumber(2) == 1`) of applying confusion. The C64 applies 0 damage
and always applies confusion.

**Fix:** Remove the `lda #0; sta zp_combat_dmg` lines. Add 50% roll before applying confusion
(see RP7-4).

#### RP7-4: Confusion missing 50% chance — MEDIUM

In umoria, confusion only applies 50% of the time:
```cpp
if (randomNumber(2) == 1) {
    // apply confusion
}
```

The C64 `mon_atk_effect_confuse` always applies confusion when the attack hits (no random check).
This makes confusion effects twice as frequent as umoria intends.

**Fix:** Add `lda #2; jsr rng_range; cmp #0; bne !mec_done+` before applying confusion effect.

#### RP7-5: Confusion doesn't stack — LOW

In umoria, confusion stacks: `py.flags.confused += 3` always runs (even if already confused),
and if not previously confused, also adds `randomNumber(creature_level)`. The C64 returns
immediately if already confused (`bne !mec_done+` at monster_attack.s:413).

**Fix:** Remove the early return. If already confused, add 3 turns. If not, add
`rng_range(creature_level) + 3`.

#### RP7-6: Poison doesn't stack — LOW

In umoria (monster.cpp:1668): `py.flags.poisoned += randomNumber(creature_level) + 5` — poison
always adds to the existing counter. The C64 returns immediately if already poisoned
(`bne !mep_done+` at monster_attack.s:378).

**Fix:** Remove the early return. Always add `rng_range(cr_level) + 5` to poison timer.

#### RP7-7: Three slow creatures run at normal speed — MEDIUM

White Worm Mass (#2), Green Worm Mass (#10), and Creeping Copper Coins (#15) have umoria speed=10
(half speed — acts every other player turn). The C64 has them at speed=1 (normal — acts every turn).
This makes them move twice as often as umoria intends.

In umoria, speed < 11 means the creature acts less frequently (speed 10 = every other turn).
The C64 has no "slow" category — only 0 (broken, see RP7-1), 1 (normal), 2 (fast).

**Fix options:**
1. Add speed=0 handling (see RP7-1) that includes "slow" via a fractional counter.
2. Simpler: keep the 0/1/2 model but make 0 = "slow" (acts every other turn), 1 = normal,
   2 = fast. Rename from "immobile" to "slow". Attack-only creatures (RP7-1) need a separate
   flag regardless.

#### RP7-8: Fear attack wrongly applies AC reduction — LOW

`mon_atk_effect_dispatch` routes fear (ATK_FEAR) through `mon_atk_ac_reduce` (monster_attack.s:367):
```
!maed_fear:
    jsr mon_atk_ac_reduce
```

In umoria (monster.cpp:1577-1588), fear attacks call `playerTakesHit(damage, ...)` with full dice
damage — no AC reduction. Only currently impacts Poltergeist (#13, 1d1 fear attack) so low impact.

**Fix:** Remove `jsr mon_atk_ac_reduce` from the fear handler.

#### RP7-9: Poison tick ignores CON — LOW

C64 (turn.s:30-32) deals flat 1 HP/turn poison damage. In umoria (`playerUpdatePoisonedState` in
game_run.cpp:550), poison damage per turn varies by CON adjustment: 0-4 HP/turn. High CON
characters take damage every 2-4 turns, low CON characters take 2-4 HP/turn.

Low priority — the flat 1 HP/turn is a reasonable simplification that averages out over time.

#### Summary of Review Pass 7 findings

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix complexity |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|
| RP7-1 | **CRITICAL** | Speed=0 creatures can't attack (4 of 20 broken) | Medium — add flag + special processing |
| RP7-2 | **MEDIUM** | Poison AC reduction wrong | Trivial — remove 1 JSR |
| RP7-3 | **MEDIUM** | Confusion deals no damage | Trivial — remove 2 lines |
| RP7-4 | **MEDIUM** | Confusion missing 50% chance | Easy — add rng check |
| RP7-5 | LOW | Confusion doesn't stack | Easy — restructure handler |
| RP7-6 | LOW | Poison doesn't stack | Easy — remove early return |
| RP7-7 | **MEDIUM** | 3 slow creatures at normal speed | Medium — requires speed model change |
| RP7-8 | LOW | Fear AC reduction wrong | Trivial — remove 1 JSR |
| RP7-9 | LOW | Poison tick ignores CON | Low priority simplification |

### Review Pass 8 — Post-RP7-Fix Verification (2026-02-11)

Verified all RP7 fixes (commit `37552c0`) against umoria source. All 8 actionable RP7 bugs
confirmed fixed correctly. Also verified new Phase 5 additions (HP regen, starvation, light
tracking, effect expiration messages). Found 3 remaining issues.

#### RP7 fix verification results

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---------|--------|
| RP7-1 | Speed=0 creatures can't attack | **FIXED** — CF_ATTACK_ONLY flag added to `cr_mflags`. Attack-only creatures set to speed=1. `monster_try_step` checks CF_ATTACK_ONLY to block movement while still allowing adjacency attacks. |
| RP7-2 | Poison AC reduction wrong | **FIXED** — `mon_atk_effect_dispatch` routes poison directly to `mon_atk_effect_poison`, no AC reduction. |
| RP7-3 | Confusion deals no damage | **FIXED** — Confusion handler no longer zeroes `zp_combat_dmg`. Full dice damage passes through. |
| RP7-4 | Confusion missing 50% chance | **FIXED** — `rng_range(2)` check added: 0 = apply confusion, 1 = skip. |
| RP7-5 | Confusion doesn't stack | **FIXED** — Already confused: `+= 3`. New confusion: `rng_range(cr_level) + 3`. |
| RP7-6 | Poison doesn't stack | **FIXED** — Always adds `rng_range(cr_level) + 5` to existing timer. Message only on first poisoning. |
| RP7-7 | 3 slow creatures at normal speed | **FIXED** — White Worm (#2), Green Worm (#10), Copper Coins (#15) now speed=0. `monster_ai_tick` skips speed=0 on odd turns (acts every other turn). Verified against umoria speed=10 (half speed). |
| RP7-8 | Fear AC reduction wrong | **FIXED** — Fear handler passes through full dice damage, no AC reduction. |
| RP7-9 | Poison tick ignores CON | **Accepted simplification** — flat 1 HP/turn. |

#### New additions verified correct

1. **HP regeneration** (`turn_tick_regen`, turn.s:210-281) — CON-based counter (8-50 turns per
   1 HP heal). Poison suppresses regen. `zp_eff_regen` active doubles tick rate. Caps at max HP
   with 16-bit comparison. Resets counter from `regen_rate` table indexed by CON-3.

2. **Starvation damage** (`turn_tick_hunger`, turn.s:187-204) — When food counter reaches 0,
   deals 1 HP/turn and calls `player_death_check`. Correct behavior.

3. **Effect expiration messages** (turn.s:20-144) — Poison ("YOU FEEL BETTER."), blindness
   ("YOU CAN SEE AGAIN." + viewport redraw), confusion ("YOU FEEL LESS CONFUSED."), paralysis
   ("YOU CAN MOVE AGAIN.") all print correctly when their timers reach 0.

4. **Light source tracking** (`turn_tick_light`, turn.s:309-354) — Decrements charges per turn,
   warns at 10 ("YOUR LIGHT IS GROWING DIM."), expires at 0 ("YOUR LIGHT HAS GONE OUT." +
   sets `zp_light_radius` to 0 + unequips light).

#### RP8-1: Poltergeist speed wrong — MEDIUM

Poltergeist (#13) has `cr_speed` = 1 (normal) in monster.s:97. In umoria (`data_creatures.cpp`),
Poltergeist has speed = 13, meaning +3 over normal (very fast). The C64's maximum speed is 2
(double move), so the correct mapping is speed=2.

Huge Brown Bat (#14) is already correctly at speed=2 (umoria speed=12, double speed).

**Fix:** Change `cr_speed` index 13 from 1 to 2. One byte change.

#### RP8-2: Paralysis zeroes damage — LOW

`mon_atk_effect_dispatch` (monster_attack.s:356-357) zeroes `zp_combat_dmg` for paralysis:
```
!maed_paralyze:
    lda #0
    sta zp_combat_dmg
```

In umoria (monster.cpp:1620-1634), paralysis calls `playerTakesHit(damage, death_description)`
FIRST (applying full dice damage), then checks saving throw and applies paralysis effect.
Damage should not be zeroed.

**Practical impact: NONE currently.** The only paralysis creature (Floating Eye, #8) has 0d0
attack dice, so damage is already 0 before zeroing. However, the pattern is wrong for
correctness — future paralysis creatures with non-zero dice would be affected.

**Fix:** Remove `lda #0; sta zp_combat_dmg` from `!maed_paralyze`. Let dice damage pass through.

#### RP8-3: Paralysis timer offset wrong — LOW

C64 `mon_atk_effect_paralyze` uses `rng_range(cr_level) + 1`, giving a range of [1, level].
For the level-1 special case, it hardcodes 2.

umoria uses `randomNumber(creature_level) + 3`, giving a range of [4, level+3].

For Floating Eye (level 1): C64 = 2 turns, umoria = 4 turns.
For a hypothetical level 3 creature: C64 = [1, 3], umoria = [4, 6].

Paralysis is consistently ~2-3 turns shorter than umoria intends. This makes paralysis less
threatening than it should be.

**Fix:** Change `adc #1` to `adc #4` (equivalent to umoria's randomNumber offset after accounting
for rng_range's [0,N-1] vs randomNumber's [1,N]). Update level-1 special case from 2 to 5.

#### Summary of Review Pass 8 findings

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix complexity |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|
| RP8-1 | **MEDIUM** | Poltergeist speed=1, should be 2 | Trivial — 1 byte |
| RP8-2 | LOW | Paralysis zeroes damage (no practical impact) | Trivial — remove 2 lines |
| RP8-3 | LOW | Paralysis timer +1 should be +4 | Trivial — change 2 constants |

### Review Pass 9 — Post-RP8-Fix + Phase 6.5 Review (2026-02-11)

Verified RP8 fixes (commit `d63dc07`) and reviewed Phase 6.5 item identification system
(commit `d1788f4`). RP8 fixes confirmed correct with one residual off-by-one. Phase 6.5
identification system (Fisher-Yates shuffle, name/color resolution, quaff, read scroll,
inventory/render integration) is well-structured and correct. Found 3 issues.

#### RP8 fix verification results

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---------|--------|
| RP8-1 | Poltergeist speed wrong | **FIXED** — `cr_speed[13]` changed from 1 to 2 (monster.s:97). Correct. |
| RP8-2 | Paralysis zeroes damage | **FIXED** — `lda #0; sta zp_combat_dmg` removed from `!maed_paralyze` (monster_attack.s:355). Full dice damage passes through. |
| RP8-3 | Paralysis timer offset wrong | **PARTIALLY FIXED** — General formula changed from `+1` to `+4`. Correct for level >= 2. However, **level-1 special case hardcodes 5 instead of 4** — see RP9-1. |

#### Phase 6.5 items verified correct

1. **Fisher-Yates shuffle** (item.s:1283-1370) — Correct implementation. Loop from i=N-1 down
   to 1, pick j in [0, i] via `rng_range(i+1)`, swap. X saved/restored around `rng_range` call.
   5 potion descriptors, 5 scroll descriptors, 4 ring descriptors — more descriptors than item
   types ensures unique assignments.

2. **`item_get_name_ptr`** (item.s:1382-1445) — Correctly maps type → id_known check → local
   index (subtract category base) → shuffle table → name pointer. Returns real name for known
   types, randomized description for unknown.

3. **`item_get_floor_color`** (item.s:1453-1500) — Same pattern as name resolution. Clobbers X
   (documented), verified safe in both render_viewport (dungeon_render.s:250-252) and
   render_single_tile (dungeon_render.s:519-521) — X not needed after color stored.

4. **Flag preservation on pickup** (item.s:886-887, 451) — `fi_flags,x → fi_add_flags →
   inv_flags,x` chain correctly preserves IF_CURSED through pickup. Test 30 validates.

5. **Quaff effects** (player_items.s) — Cure Light Wounds HP cap (16-bit comparison handles all
   cases), Speed timer stacking with 255 cap, Poison damage+death+timer stacking all correct.

6. **Scroll effects** (player_items.s) — Light room bounds check correct, Identify scroll
   consumes before second prompt (matches classic Moria), Teleport clears/sets FLAG_OCCUPIED.

7. **Inventory/render integration** — `ui_inv_display`, `ui_equip_display`, `item_append_name`,
   and both render functions all correctly delegate to `item_get_name_ptr`/`item_get_floor_color`.

#### RP9-1: Paralysis timer off-by-one for level 1 — LOW

Residual from RP8-3 fix. The general formula `rng_range(level) + 4` gives [4, level+3], correctly
matching umoria's `randomNumber(level) + 3` = [4, level+3]. But the level-1 special case
(monster_attack.s:504) hardcodes 5:

```
lda #5                      // Level 1: 0 + 4 + 1 = 5
```

The comment's arithmetic "0 + 4 + 1 = 5" is wrong — there's no "+1" in the formula. For level 1,
`rng_range(1)` always returns 0, so the result should be `0 + 4 = 4`. umoria confirms:
`randomNumber(1) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4`.

The special case is also unnecessary — `rng_range(1)` safely returns 0, so the general path
would give the correct result for level 1.

**Practical impact:** Floating Eye paralysis lasts 5 turns instead of 4. Minor balance difference.

**Fix:** Remove the level-1 special case entirely, or change `lda #5` to `lda #4`.

#### RP9-2: `item_drop` doesn't preserve flags — MEDIUM

`item_drop` (item.s:982-994) copies `inv_item_id`, `inv_qty`, and `inv_p1` to `fi_add_*`
variables before calling `floor_item_add`, but does NOT copy `inv_flags` to `fi_add_flags`.
Since `floor_item_add` always writes 0 to `fi_flags,x` (item.s:311), a drop+pickup round-trip
loses IF_CURSED (and IF_IDENTIFIED).

This means a player could uncurse an item by dropping and picking it back up.

**Fix:** Add `lda inv_flags,x` / `sta fi_add_flags` in `item_drop` before the `floor_item_add`
call, then post-hoc set `fi_flags,x` from `fi_add_flags` after `floor_item_add` succeeds
(same pattern used in `item_spawn_level` at item.s:664-667).

#### RP9-3: `floor_item_add` ignores `fi_add_flags` — LOW (design debt)

Root cause of RP9-2. `floor_item_add` (item.s:311) unconditionally writes `lda #0; sta fi_flags,x`
instead of copying `fi_add_flags`. Every caller must remember to post-hoc patch `fi_flags,x`
after the call — currently `item_spawn_level` does this (item.s:664-667 and 766-768) but
`item_drop` does not.

**Fix (optional cleanup):** Change `floor_item_add` to copy `fi_add_flags` instead of hardcoding
0. This would eliminate the need for post-hoc patching in callers, making the API less error-prone.
If done, also update the function's input comment to document `fi_add_flags`.

#### Summary of Review Pass 9 findings

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix complexity | Status |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| RP9-1 | LOW | Paralysis timer level-1 special case: 5 should be 4 | Trivial — remove special case | **FIXED** — removed level-1 special case; general formula handles it |
| RP9-2 | **MEDIUM** | `item_drop` loses IF_CURSED/IF_IDENTIFIED flags | Easy — add `inv_flags→fi_add_flags` copy | **FIXED** — added flags copy in `item_drop` before `floor_item_add` |
| RP9-3 | LOW | `floor_item_add` ignores `fi_add_flags` (design debt) | Easy — copy `fi_add_flags` instead of hardcoding 0 | **FIXED** — `floor_item_add` now copies `fi_add_flags`; removed post-hoc patches; added init to gold path + all tests |

### Review Pass 10 — Phase 7 Steps 7.0–7.5 Implementation Review (2026-02-12)

Reviewed all three new Phase 7 files (`spell_effects.s` ~1014 lines, `spell_data.s` ~137 lines,
`player_magic.s` ~1258 lines) plus integration points in `main.s`, `combat.s`, and `player_create.s`.
Cross-referenced against BUILDPLAN steps 7.0–7.5, calling conventions of all referenced functions
(`math_dice`, `monster_find_at`, `monster_get_ptr`, `monster_remove`, `rng_range`, `get_direction_target`,
`stat_bonus_index`, `combat_append_str`, `combat_award_xp`, `combat_check_levelup`, `find_random_floor`),
zero-page allocations (`zp_math_tmp0/1` at $20/$21 confirmed separate from `zp_temp0-2` at $02-$04),
and encoding (`.encoding "screencode_upper"` confirmed set globally in `main.s` line 20).

**Files reviewed:** `spell_effects.s`, `spell_data.s`, `player_magic.s`, `main.s` (dispatch),
`combat.s` (level-up hooks), `player_create.s` (starting spells), `monster.s` (CF_UNDEAD),
`dungeon_features.s` (find_random_floor, trap_check_at_player), `dungeon_render.s` (monster
rendering), `math.s` (math_dice/math_multiply), `player.s` (stat_bonus_index), `tables.s`
(spell_stat_bonus), `screen.s` (screen_put_string), `zeropage.s`.

#### Findings

**RP10-1 (BUG): Monster HP=0 treated as alive in spell effect damage**

In `spell_effects.s`, the death check after 16-bit HP subtraction uses only `bpl` (branch if
HP_HI >= 0), meaning a monster at exactly 0 HP survives. This is INCONSISTENT with `combat.s`
`combat_apply_damage` (lines 412–449), which checks BOTH `bmi` (HP < 0) AND `ora` for exact
zero (HP == 0), treating HP <= 0 as dead.

Affected locations:
- `eff_bolt` line 702: `bpl !eb_fizzle+`
- `eff_damage_adjacent` line 765: `bpl !eda_next+`
- `eff_dispel_undead` line 1002: `bpl !edu_next+`
- `mage_effect_dispatch` effect 0 (Magic Missile) line 934: `bpl !med_rts+`

**Fix:** After each `bpl !alive+`, add an explicit zero check:
```
    bmi !dead+
    ldy #MX_HP_LO
    lda (zp_ptr0),y
    ldy #MX_HP_HI
    ora (zp_ptr0),y
    bne !alive+
!dead:
```
Or extract a shared `eff_check_monster_dead` subroutine since this pattern repeats 4 times.
Alternatively, match the `combat_apply_damage` pattern: `bmi` then `beq` on the OR of both bytes.

**RP10-2 (BUG): `eff_destroy_traps_doors` does not remove traps from trap table**

`eff_destroy_traps_doors` (spell_effects.s lines 804–869) changes adjacent TILE_TRAP map tiles
to TILE_FLOOR, but does NOT modify or remove the corresponding entries in `trap_x`/`trap_y`/
`trap_type` arrays. The comment at line 865 acknowledges this: "simplified: clear the whole trap
table since most are revealed" — but the code doesn't actually do it.

`trap_check_at_player` (dungeon_features.s line 330) triggers traps by scanning the
`trap_x`/`trap_y` table, NOT by checking map tile types. Therefore, a trap that was "destroyed"
on the map (tile changed to TILE_FLOOR) will STILL TRIGGER when the player steps on it.

**Fix:** After the direction loop, scan `trap_x`/`trap_y` for entries matching each of the 8
adjacent positions and remove them (swap with last entry + decrement `trap_count`):
```
    // Remove matching traps from trap table
    ldx #0
!scan:
    cpx trap_count
    bcs !scan_done
    // For each of 8 directions, check if trap_x[x],trap_y[x] matches
    // If match: swap with last entry, dec trap_count, don't inc x
    ...
```

**RP10-3 (BUG): `find_random_floor` does not check FLAG_OCCUPIED**

`find_random_floor` (dungeon_features.s lines 165–200) selects a random floor tile by checking
only `TILE_TYPE_MASK == TILE_FLOOR`. It does NOT check that `FLAG_OCCUPIED` is clear. This means
`eff_teleport_self` and `eff_phase_door` can teleport the player onto a tile already occupied by
a monster, resulting in both entities sharing a tile.

Compare with `find_monster_floor` (monster.s lines 285–338) which correctly checks
`TILE_TYPE_MASK | FLAG_OCCUPIED` before accepting a tile.

**Fix:** In `find_random_floor`, change the tile check from:
```
    and #TILE_TYPE_MASK
    cmp #TILE_FLOOR
```
to:
```
    sta zp_temp0
    and #TILE_TYPE_MASK
    cmp #TILE_FLOOR
    bne !frf_next+
    lda zp_temp0
    and #FLAG_OCCUPIED
    bne !frf_next+
```

**RP10-4 (MEDIUM): BUILDPLAN test expectation for `magic_recalc_mana` is wrong**

Step 7.3 test says: "Verify `magic_recalc_mana` with INT=12, level=5 → expected max_mana
= (5*12)/8 + bonus[12-3] = 7 + 2 = 9."

The `spell_stat_bonus` table in `tables.s` (lines 196–198) has:
```
    .byte  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  1,  1  // indices 0-7 (stats 3-10)
    .byte  1,  1,  1,  2,  2,  3,  3,  3  // indices 8-15 (stats 11-18)
```
Index 9 (stat 12) = **1**, not 2. Correct expected value: (5×12)/8 + 1 = 7 + 1 = **8**.

**RP10-5 (MEDIUM): `eff_phase_door` duplicates teleport code instead of calling `eff_teleport_self`**

`eff_phase_door` (spell_effects.s lines 376–404) contains a full copy of the FLAG_OCCUPIED
clear/move/set logic from `eff_teleport_self`. After the distance-check loop selects a target
(stored in `df_target_x`/`df_target_y`), it should simply `jsr eff_teleport_self` which does
the exact same thing. The duplicated code is 28 bytes of wasted space and a maintenance hazard
(a bug fix in one copy won't automatically apply to the other).

**Fix:** Replace lines 376–404 with `jsr eff_teleport_self; rts` (or `jmp eff_teleport_self`).

**RP10-6 (MEDIUM): `eff_heal` API diverges from BUILDPLAN — 8-bit only**

The BUILDPLAN (Step 7.0) describes `eff_heal(A=dice, X=sides, Y=bonus)` with integrated dice
rolling. The implementation takes a pre-rolled 8-bit heal amount in A. This means all callers
must call `math_dice` separately, then pass `zp_math_a` to `eff_heal`. The 16-bit high byte
(`zp_math_b`) is silently discarded.

Current max heal is 5d8+5 = 45, well within 8 bits. However, the function signature mismatch
between plan and code should be documented. The current approach is arguably better (simpler
function, separation of concerns), but the BUILDPLAN should be updated to match reality.

**RP10-7 (LOW): `eff_detect_monsters` makes monster tiles permanently FLAG_VISITED**

After `eff_detect_monsters` sets FLAG_VISITED on each monster's tile, those tiles remain
permanently marked as visited. When the monster moves away, the old tile still shows as visited
floor. This is not harmful (the renderer checks FLAG_OCCUPIED before drawing a monster glyph,
so no phantom monsters appear), but it does reveal map layout in areas the player hasn't
explored — a minor information leak.

In umoria, Detect Monster is a temporary effect with a duration. Consider adding a timer
(`zp_eff_detect`, already in the ZP effect block) and only showing monsters while the timer
is active, rather than permanently marking tiles.

**RP10-8 (LOW): CMP/BEQ dispatch chains for 16 spell effects**

Both `mage_effect_dispatch` and `priest_effect_dispatch` use a linear CMP/BEQ chain (16
comparisons worst case for spell index 15). A jump table would be O(1):
```
    asl                   // index * 2
    tax
    lda mage_jmp_tbl+1,x
    pha
    lda mage_jmp_tbl,x
    pha
    rts                   // jump via RTS trick
```
This saves ~48 bytes and is faster for higher-index spells. Not critical at 16 entries but
worth considering since the same pattern will be used for potions, scrolls, wands, and staves
in steps 7.6–7.7, potentially expanding to 40+ dispatch entries total.

**RP10-9 (LOW): `stat_bonus_index` has no lower-bounds check**

`stat_bonus_index` (player.s lines 392–401) computes `stat - 3` without checking if stat < 3.
If a stat ever reaches 2 or below, the subtraction underflows to 253+ and indexes far past the
16-byte `spell_stat_bonus` table (buffer over-read).

Current stat drain code (dungeon_features.s line 500) guards with `cmp #4; bcc !no_drain+`,
preventing stats from dropping below 3. But this is an implicit contract — `stat_bonus_index`
itself is fragile.

**Fix:** Add a defensive clamp:
```
    cmp #3
    bcs !ok+
    lda #3
!ok:
```

**RP10-10 (LOW): `eff_bolt` tile passability check is too narrow**

`eff_bolt` (spell_effects.s lines 664–671) only allows bolts through `TILE_FLOOR` and
`TILE_DOOR_OPEN`. If any other passable tile types exist or are added later (e.g., stairs,
rubble), bolts would stop on them. The check should probably use a "not wall" test instead:
```
    cmp #TILE_WALL_H
    beq !eb_wall+
    cmp #TILE_WALL_V
    beq !eb_wall+
    cmp #TILE_DOOR_CLOSED
    beq !eb_wall+
    jmp !eb_check_mon+
!eb_wall:
    jmp !eb_fizzle+
```
Or better, use a tile-passability helper. For now, TILE_FLOOR covers corridors (they use the
same tile type), so this works for the current map generator. Flag for future review.

**RP10-11 (LOW): `eff_kill_monster` clears FLAG_OCCUPIED redundantly**

`eff_kill_monster` manually clears FLAG_OCCUPIED (lines 924–940), then calls `monster_remove`
(line 944) which also clears FLAG_OCCUPIED (monster.s lines 619–625). The first clear is
redundant. Removing the manual clear saves ~17 bytes.

**RP10-12 (LOW): No `eff_aggravate` implementation**

Step 7.0 lists `eff_aggravate` (wake all monsters, set MF_AWAKE) as a shared subroutine to
create. It's not used in steps 7.4/7.5, but step 7.6 needs it for Scroll of Aggravation.
It should be implemented now to keep step 7.0 complete. Implementation is trivial:
```
eff_aggravate:
    ldx #0
!loop:
    cpx #MAX_MONSTERS
    bcs !done+
    jsr monster_get_ptr
    ldy #MX_TYPE
    lda (zp_ptr0),y
    cmp #EMPTY_SLOT
    beq !next+
    ldy #MX_SLEEP_CUR
    lda #0
    sta (zp_ptr0),y       // Clear sleep
!next:
    inx
    jmp !loop-
!done:
    rts
```

#### Suggested Additional Tests

The existing test suites (`test_effects.s`, `test_combat.s`) do not cover the spell casting flow
or individual spell effects. The following runtime tests should be added:

1. **Spell dispatch correctness:** Cast each mage spell 0–15 in a controlled setup; verify the
   expected side effect occurred (e.g., Magic Missile: monster HP decreased; Light: room_lit set;
   Teleport: player position changed).
2. **Mana deduction on failure:** Set player to Mage, mana=10, force spell failure (set fail_base
   to 100), verify mana decreased but no effect applied.
3. **HP=0 kill check:** Place monster with exactly N HP, deal exactly N damage via bolt/Fire Ball,
   verify monster is removed (once RP10-1 is fixed).
4. **Phase door distance:** Set player at (40, 24), call eff_phase_door, verify new position is
   within Chebyshev distance 10 (or verify fallback behavior after 20 failed attempts).
5. **Occupied tile teleport:** Place monster on every floor tile except one, call
   eff_teleport_self, verify player lands on the unoccupied tile (once RP10-3 is fixed).
6. **Spell known bitmask boundary:** Set PL_SPELLS_KNOWN = $00/$00, player_level = 9. Call
   magic_check_new_spells. Verify spells 0–7 (lo byte) AND spells 8–9 (hi byte) are all learned
   correctly (tests the 8-bit boundary crossing).
7. **Bless/Chant timer ranges:** Cast Bless 100 times, verify all values in [12, 23]. Cast Chant
   100 times, verify all values in [24, 47].
8. **Slow Poison edge cases:** Test with poison=1 → stays 1. Test with poison=0 → stays 0
   (guard check). Test with poison=255 → becomes 128 (127 | 1).
9. **Remove Curse coverage:** Equip cursed weapon + cursed armor + non-cursed ring. Cast
   Remove Curse. Verify cursed flags cleared on weapon and armor, ring unchanged.
10. **Bolt wall stop:** Fire Lightning Bolt toward wall 2 tiles away with monster behind wall.
    Verify bolt stops at wall, monster takes no damage.
11. **Trap/Door Destroy + trigger:** Destroy adjacent trap via spell, then step on that tile.
    Verify trap does NOT trigger (once RP10-2 is fixed).
12. **Failure rate clamp:** Test with very high level (level 40, spell level 1): verify failure
    rate is clamped to 5%, not negative. Test with very low stat (stat 3): verify no underflow.

### Review Pass 11 — Step 7.6 (Expanded Potions and Scrolls)

**Scope:** `item.s`, `player_items.s`, `combat.s`, `zeropage.s`, `tests/test_item.s`, `run_tests.sh`
**Reviewer:** Claude (automated)
**Date:** 2025-02-12

#### RP11-1 (HIGH): CSW heal computes [5,40] instead of intended [10,45]

**Location:** `player_items.s:836-856`

The comment says "heal 5d8 (5× rng(8)) + 5" and BUILDPLAN line 2408 says "Heal 5d8+5".
The code rolls 5×rng(8) = 5×[0,7] = [0,35], then adds 5, giving **[5,40]**.
The +5 only compensates for `rng_range(8)` returning [0,7] instead of [1,8] — the actual
+5 bonus from the design is lost.

Intended range: 5d8+5 = [10, 45]. Actual range: [5, 40]. Off by 5 at both ends.

**Test impact:** Test 33 checks HP in [60,95] (expects 50 + [10,45] heal). With the actual
[5,40] range, heal values 5-9 produce HP 55-59 which fails the `cmp #60; bcc` lower bound
check. The test will fail intermittently (~14% of runs).

**Fix:** Replace the manual loop with `math_dice(5, 8, 5)`:
```
lda #5           ; N=5 dice
ldx #8           ; S=8 sides
ldy #5           ; bonus=5
jsr math_dice
lda zp_math_a    ; low byte (max 45, fits in 8 bits)
jsr eff_heal
```
This also saves ~14 bytes versus the manual loop.

#### RP11-2 (HIGH): Enchant Weapon/Armor broken on cursed items

**Location:** `player_items.s:1184-1198` (weapon), `player_items.s:1228-1242` (armor)

The cap check uses unsigned comparison: `lda inv_p1,x; cmp #5; bcc`. Cursed items store
negative p1 as two's complement (e.g., -3 = $FD). Unsigned $FD = 253 ≥ 5, so BCC does not
branch. The handler falls through to "already at cap" and does nothing.

In umoria, enchanting a cursed weapon/armor should: (1) clear IF_CURSED flag, (2) set p1=0,
(3) recalculate equipment, (4) display glow message.

**Fix:** Before the unsigned cap check, add a cursed-item branch:
```
!irs_ew_has:
    ldx #EQUIP_WEAPON
    lda inv_flags,x
    and #IF_CURSED
    beq !irs_ew_not_cursed+
    // Cursed → remove curse + reset to 0
    lda inv_flags,x
    and #~IF_CURSED & $ff
    sta inv_flags,x
    lda #0
    sta inv_p1,x
    jsr player_recalc_equipment
    jmp !irs_ew_msg+         ; print glow message
!irs_ew_not_cursed:
    lda inv_p1,x
    cmp #5
    bcc !irs_ew_inc+
    ...
```
Same pattern needed for Enchant Armor with EQUIP_BODY.

#### RP11-3 (MEDIUM): No test coverage for enchant on cursed items

Test 35 (Enchant Weapon) only tests with positive p1=2. No test exists for:
- Enchant weapon with negative p1 ($FD = -3) and IF_CURSED flag set → should remove curse, set p1=0
- Enchant armor with IF_CURSED flag → same behavior
- Enchant at exact cap (p1=5) → should print "nothing happens", p1 unchanged

#### RP11-4 (MEDIUM): Heroism, Infravision, Protect from Evil timers have no game effect

`zp_eff_hero`, `zp_eff_infra`, and `zp_eff_protect` are set by their respective
potions/scrolls and decremented each turn by `turn.s`, but **no code checks these timers
to apply gameplay effects:**
- Heroism: should grant +1 to-hit and +10 max HP while active (per umoria)
- Infravision: should reveal monsters within range while active
- Protect from Evil: should reduce damage from evil monsters while active

The timers are pure stubs — using these items currently has no gameplay effect. Either the
consumption code should be added (likely a Phase 8+ concern) or the BUILDPLAN should
explicitly note these as infrastructure-only stubs awaiting integration.

#### RP11-5 (LOW): Word of Recall overwrites timer (correct but undocumented)

`zp_eff_word_recall` is stored directly (`sta`), not added to existing value. Reading a
second Word of Recall scroll overwrites the timer rather than extending it. This matches
umoria behavior but differs from other timer effects (Heroism, Blindness, etc.) which
stack via `clc; adc`. Should be documented as intentional.

#### RP11-6 (LOW): RP10-12 resolved — eff_aggravate IS implemented

RP10-12 stated eff_aggravate was not implemented. It exists at `spell_effects.s:1046` and
is successfully called by the Aggravate scroll handler at `player_items.s:1270`. RP10-12
status should be updated to Resolved.

#### Suggested tests for Step 7.6

1. **CSW heal range [10,45]:** After fixing RP11-1, verify heal from HP=50 gives HP in
   [60,95]. Run multiple iterations to catch edge cases.
2. **Enchant Weapon on cursed item:** Set EQUIP_WEAPON p1=$FD (-3), inv_flags=IF_CURSED.
   Read Enchant Weapon scroll. Verify p1=0, IF_CURSED cleared.
3. **Enchant Armor on cursed item:** Same test for EQUIP_BODY slot.
4. **Enchant at exact cap:** Set p1=5, read Enchant scroll → verify p1 stays 5.
5. **Heroism timer stacking:** Drink two Heroism potions → verify timer in [50,98] range
   (not overflow beyond 98).
6. **Protect from Evil timer range:** Verify timer in [25,49] after reading scroll.

#### Summary of Review Pass 11 findings

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix complexity | Status |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| RP11-1 | **HIGH** | CSW heal [5,40] instead of [10,45]; Test 33 fails intermittently | Easy — use math_dice(5,8,5) or change adc #5 → adc #10 | **Fixed** — replaced manual loop with `math_dice(5,8,5)` giving correct [10,45] range |
| RP11-2 | **HIGH** | Enchant Weapon/Armor broken on cursed items (unsigned cmp treats -N as >5) | Medium — add IF_CURSED branch before cap check in both handlers | **Fixed** — added IF_CURSED check before cap comparison; cursed items get curse cleared + p1 set to 0 |

### Review Pass 12 — RP11 Fix Verification

**Scope:** `player_items.s`, `tests/test_item.s`, `run_tests.sh`, `BUILDPLAN.md`
**Reviewer:** Claude (automated)
**Date:** 2025-02-12
**Commit reviewed:** `b94e59e Fix Review Pass 11 findings for Step 7.6 potions/scrolls`

All six RP11 fixes verified correct. No bugs found.

- **RP11-1 fix (CSW heal):** `math_dice(5, 8, 5)` produces correct [10,45] range.
  `zp_math_a` low byte (max 45) fits 8 bits. Test 33's [60,95] check now consistent.
- **RP11-2 fix (Enchant on cursed items):** Both weapon and armor handlers check
  `IF_CURSED` before the unsigned cap comparison. Cursed path correctly clears flag
  via `and #~IF_CURSED & $ff`, sets p1=0, calls `player_recalc_equipment`, jumps to
  shared `!irs_ew_msg` / `!irs_ea_msg` glow message label. Normal-increment path
  unchanged.
- **RP11-3 fix (New tests 39-40):** Test 39 sets p1=$FD with IF_CURSED, verifies
  p1=0 and flag cleared. Test 40 sets p1=5, verifies no increment past cap. Copy
  loop `ldx #39` (40 bytes) and run_tests.sh `"0400 0427" 40` both correct.
- **RP11-4/5/6 (Comments and status updates):** Infrastructure NOTE comments and
  WoR overwrite comment all correctly placed.

#### RP12-1 (LOW): Armor enchant cursed/cap paths lack dedicated tests

Tests 39-40 only cover the **weapon** enchant path. The armor handlers
(`!irs_ea_has` cursed branch and cap check) are structurally identical but untested.
Adding tests 41-42 mirroring tests 39-40 for EQUIP_BODY would complete coverage.

#### Summary of Review Pass 12 findings

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix complexity | Status |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| RP12-1 | LOW | Armor enchant cursed/cap paths untested (weapon-only coverage) | Easy — mirror tests 39-40 for EQUIP_BODY | Open |

### Review Pass 13 — Steps 7.9 and 7.10 (Mana Regen, WoR, Integration, Polish)

**Scope:** `turn.s`, `player_magic.s`, `player_items.s`, `sound.s`, `ui_character.s`,
`ui_help.s`, `monster_magic.s`, `tests/test_effects.s`, `run_tests.sh`
**Reviewer:** Claude (automated)
**Date:** 2026-02-12

#### RP13-1 (HIGH): Confused casting blocked by known-spell and level checks

**Location:** `player_magic.s:160-236`

When confused, a random spell index (0-15) is selected at line 166-168, replacing the
player's choice. However, the code falls through to the known-spell check (line 164-191)
and the minimum level check (line 218-236). If the random spell isn't known (the common
case for most players), the handler prints "YOU DON'T KNOW THAT SPELL" and returns CLC
(no turn consumed, no mana deducted). If the spell is too high level, same result.

**In umoria**, confused casting:
- Bypasses both known and level requirements
- Deducts mana for the random spell (checked normally)
- Rolls for failure normally
- Executes the random spell's effect on success

**Current behavior:** Confusion during casting is effectively harmless — most random spells
will be unknown, so the player just gets an error message and no turn is consumed. This
defeats the entire purpose of the confusion mechanic during spellcasting.

**Fix:** Two changes needed:
1. In the confused branch, add `jmp !pm_known+` to skip the known-spell check:
```
    lda zp_eff_confuse
    beq !pm_not_confused+
    lda #16
    jsr rng_range
    sta pm_spell_idx
    jmp !pm_known+             ; Skip known check when confused
!pm_not_confused:
```
2. Before the level check at `!pm_mana_ok`, add a confusion bypass:
```
!pm_mana_ok:
    lda zp_eff_confuse
    bne !pm_lvl_ok+            ; Skip level check when confused
    // Normal level check follows...
```

#### RP13-2 (MEDIUM): BUILDPLAN mana regen rate contradicts implementation

**Location:** BUILDPLAN line ~2864 vs `turn.s` implementation

BUILDPLAN prose says "recover 1 mana per 3 turns" with regen making it "1 per 2 turns".
BUILDPLAN code block says "Every 2 turns (basic rate)" with `and #$01`.
Implementation matches the code block: normal = 1 per 2 turns, with regen = 1 per turn.

The prose and code block within the BUILDPLAN contradict each other. The code block and
implementation agree. Fix: update the prose from "per 3 turns" to "per 2 turns" and
regen from "per 2 turns" to "every turn".

#### RP13-3 (MEDIUM): PL_MAX_DLVL offset differs from BUILDPLAN

BUILDPLAN step 7.9 line ~2910 says "Use `PL_SPARE_63` (player struct offset 63)".
Implementation uses `PL_MAX_DLVL = 56` (offset 56). `PL_SPARE_63` remains unused at
offset 63. Not a code bug — the architect chose a different offset — but the BUILDPLAN
should be updated to match.

#### RP13-4 (LOW): No test for confused casting

The confusion-during-casting interaction (Step 7.10 checklist item 2) has no dedicated
test. A test should:
1. Set zp_eff_confuse > 0, put all 16 spells known, sufficient mana
2. Call pm_do_cast with keyboard input for spell 'A'
3. Verify a spell was actually cast (mana decreased, turn consumed)
4. This would also expose the RP13-1 bug if spells were NOT all known

#### RP13-5 (LOW): No test for extra regen on odd turn

Tests 11-12 cover normal regen (even turn) and warrior no-regen. Missing:
- Set zp_eff_regen > 0, zp_turn_lo = 1 (odd turn), verify MP still increases
  (extra regen bypasses the even-turn check)

#### RP13-6 (LOW): No test for Word of Recall fizzle

When recalling from town (dlvl=0) with PL_MAX_DLVL=0 (player has never entered the
dungeon), the recall should fizzle (jump to `!no_recall`). No test covers this path.

#### RP13-7 (LOW): Intermediate fix commit (e427147) notes

The fix commit between RP12 and Step 7.9 correctly:
- Replaced `mm_check_death` with `player_death_check` in `monster_magic.s` bolt and
  breath handlers (carries through from `mon_atk_apply_damage`)
- Hit sound no longer plays on player death (correct — death has its own SFX)
- Added missing `monster_magic.s` import to `test_item.s`
- Updated stale test bounds

No issues found in this commit.

#### Verified correct in Steps 7.9/7.10

- **Word of Recall teleportation:** Clears FLAG_OCCUPIED at old position, sets
  level_entry_dir correctly (1=ascending for dungeon→town, 0=descending for
  town→dungeon), calls full level regeneration chain, stops running, redraws UI.
- **Mana regen logic:** Warriors excluded (PL_SPELL_TYPE=0), max cap check correct,
  extra regen skips turn parity check, syncs to player_data.
- **Blindness blocks scroll reading:** Returns CLC immediately (no turn consumed).
- **Hunger penalty:** +20 to failure rate at HUNGER_FAINT or worse, capped at 95.
  Applied after the base [5,95] clamp, so max effective failure with hunger is 95%.
- **Sound effects:** SFX_SPELL and SFX_SPELL_FAIL correctly added to sfx_table at
  indices 6-7. Triangle wave for spell, noise buzz for fizzle. Both use voice 3.
- **Help screen:** New line "M CAST SPELL     P PRAY", HELP_LINE_COUNT=22, pointer
  tables extended correctly in both lo and hi arrays.
- **Character sheet:** Spells Known (N/16) displayed for spell-casters only (row 11).
  count_spells_known correctly iterates all 16 bits via spell_bit_mask. "Press any key"
  moved to row 16 to accommodate.
- **Max depth tracking:** Already present in main.s (lines 338-341), updates on
  stairs-down. PL_MAX_DLVL initialized to 0 at player creation (line 165).
- **Tests 11-18:** All structurally correct — mana regen, warrior no-regen, recall
  both directions, hunger penalty, no-hunger baseline, count_spells_known, blindness
  blocks scrolls.

#### Suggested tests for Steps 7.9/7.10

1. **Confused cast (all spells known):** Set 16 spells known, confuse > 0, cast →
   verify mana decreased and turn consumed (currently fails due to RP13-1).
2. **Confused cast (few spells known):** Set 3 spells known, confuse > 0, cast →
   should still cast random spell (currently blocked by known check).
3. **Extra regen on odd turn:** zp_eff_regen=5, zp_turn_lo=1, mage MP=5/20 →
   verify MP becomes 6 (bypass even-turn check).
4. **Recall fizzle:** dlvl=0, PL_MAX_DLVL=0, recall timer=1 → verify dlvl stays 0.
5. **Mana regen stops at max:** MP=19, MMP=20, tick even turn → MP=20. Tick again →
   MP stays 20.

#### Summary of Review Pass 13 findings

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix complexity | Status |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| RP13-1 | **HIGH** | Confused casting blocked by known-spell and level checks (confusion is harmless) | Easy — add `jmp !pm_known+` in confused branch + confusion bypass at level check | **Fixed** |
| RP13-2 | **MEDIUM** | BUILDPLAN says "1 per 3 turns" but code/implementation do 1 per 2 turns | Trivial — fix BUILDPLAN prose | **Fixed** |
| RP13-3 | **MEDIUM** | PL_MAX_DLVL at offset 56, BUILDPLAN says offset 63 (PL_SPARE_63) | Trivial — update BUILDPLAN | **Fixed** |
| RP13-4 | LOW | No test for confused casting interaction | Easy — add test with confusion + known spells | **Fixed** (test 19) |
| RP13-5 | LOW | No test for extra regen on odd turn | Trivial — same as test 11 with regen=5 and odd turn | **Fixed** (test 20) |
| RP13-6 | LOW | No test for Word of Recall fizzle (town, never visited dungeon) | Trivial — set PL_MAX_DLVL=0, verify dlvl unchanged | **Fixed** (test 21) |

### Review Pass 14 — Phase 8 (Stores) Implementation Review (2026-02-12)

Full review of Phase 8 store implementation: `store.s`, `ui_store.s`, `math.s` (math_mul_16x8),
`tables.s` (chr_price_adj/chr_sell_adj), main.s integration, and test files. Cross-referenced
against umoria source (`store.cpp`, `store_inventory.cpp`, `data_store_owners.cpp`,
`data_stores.cpp`, `player_stats.cpp`) for pricing formulas, store categories, restocking,
and haggling behavior.

**Files reviewed:**
- `store.s` — 6 stores, SoA inventory (72 slots), category bitmasks, restocking, pricing, gold ops
- `ui_store.s` — Store UI loop, buy/sell flows, door detection, screen drawing
- `math.s` — math_mul_16x8 (16×8→24-bit multiply)
- `tables.s` — chr_price_adj (100-130%), chr_sell_adj (25-50%)
- `item.s` — it_cost_lo/hi (47 entries), it_category, ICAT constants
- `main.s` — store_init_all at startup, store door check in main loop, restock on stair ascent
- `turn.s` — Word of Recall code path (missing restock)
- `player_items.s` — inv_add_item, inv_remove_item, inv_count_items
- `dungeon_gen.s` — STORE_COUNT, store_door_x/y, store positions
- `zeropage.s` — zp_store_idx ($8C), zp_store_slot ($8D)
- `tests/test_store.s` — 17 tests (all pass; VICE detection issue only)
- `tests/test_store_debug.s` — 13 deterministic tests (pass)
- `tests/test_store_iso.s` — 9 isolation tests (pass)

**Verification approach:** Built test_store.s, confirmed segment layout ($0810-$90D0),
checked symbol addresses (tc_results=$8E25, test_start=$8E39, BRK=$90CF, tc_count=$90D0),
ran all tests in VICE with correct breakpoint — all 17 pass in 3.1M cycles. Verified
store door positions match building geometry. Verified price arithmetic for boundary cases
(max cost 300 × max adj 130 = 39,000 fits 16-bit intermediate).

**Documented design deviations (acceptable):**
- 12 items per store vs 24 in umoria (noted in BUILDPLAN)
- No haggling (accept/decline at offered price, noted in BUILDPLAN)
- Restock on town re-entry vs umoria's turn-based (every 1000 turns, noted in BUILDPLAN)
- No item identification affecting prices (C64 scope limitation)
- No item stacking in store slots (each item takes one slot)

#### Findings

**RP14-1 (HIGH — Word of Recall to town skips store restock)**

`turn.s:157-163`: When Word of Recall teleports the player from dungeon to town, the code
sets `zp_player_dlvl=0`, sets `level_entry_dir=1`, and jumps to `recall_generate` which
calls `level_generate`, `monster_spawn_level`, `item_spawn_level`, etc. — but does NOT
call `store_restock_all`. In contrast, `main.s:405-407` correctly calls `store_restock_all`
when ascending stairs to town (dlvl becomes 0).

The BUILDPLAN Step 8.1 says "Inventory restocking on town re-entry." Word of Recall is a
form of town re-entry. The fix is to add `jsr store_restock_all` in the WoR-to-town path,
after setting dlvl=0 and before `jmp !recall_generate+`.

**RP14-2 (MEDIUM — BUILDPLAN says "race modifier" but implementation omits it)**

BUILDPLAN Step 8.3: "Base price x charisma modifier x **race modifier**." The implementation
uses ONLY charisma adjustment (`chr_price_adj` for buying, `chr_sell_adj` for selling).
No race-based price modifier exists.

In umoria, a `race_gold_adjustments[8][8]` table adjusts prices by ±5-35% based on
owner_race × player_race. The C64 store owners have names but no race data. This is a
reasonable simplification for the C64 scope, but the BUILDPLAN should be updated to remove
the "race modifier" reference to match the implementation, or a race modifier should be added.

**RP14-3 (MEDIUM — Enchantment and charges ignored in pricing)**

`calc_buy_price` and `calc_sell_price` use only the base item type cost (`it_cost_lo/hi`).
Enchantment level (`si_p1` / `inv_p1`) and item flags are completely ignored.

Impact: A +3 enchanted sword and a +0 sword of the same type cost the same to buy and sell.
A wand with 8 charges and a wand with 0 charges cost the same. In umoria, enchanted
weapons/armor get `(to_hit + to_damage + to_ac) × 100` added to base value, and
wands/staves get `(cost/20) × charges` added.

This is a design simplification but notable — players get no extra gold for selling superior
items, and store-stocked enchanted items are underpriced. Consider adding at least
`p1 × enchant_bonus_per_category` to the price calculation.

**RP14-4 (MEDIUM — Cursed items sellable at full base price)**

`calc_sell_price` does not check the `IF_CURSED` flag. A cursed item sells for the same
price as a normal item of the same type. In umoria, `storeItemValue()` returns 0 for
cursed items (identified as `ID_DAMD`), preventing sale.

The fix is to check `IF_CURSED` at the start of the sell flow (in `store_sell` at
`!ssell_cat_ok`) and either refuse the sale or set the price to 0. Additionally, when
a cursed item is sold to a store, it pollutes the store inventory — another player could
buy it back.

**RP14-5 (LOW — Store owner max gold not implemented)**

BUILDPLAN Step 8.1 mentions "Store owner data (name, race, max gold)." The implementation
has owner names (displayed in UI) but no race or max gold. Stores will buy items of
unlimited value. In umoria, each owner has `max_cost` (250-32,000 gold) which limits
both what items appear in auto-generated stock and the maximum price the owner will pay.

Update the BUILDPLAN to remove "race, max gold" from the owner data description if these
features are intentionally deferred.

**RP14-6 (LOW — test_store.s VICE breakpoint detection failure)**

All 17 tests in `test_store.s` pass correctly (verified by running in VICE with breakpoint
at BRK address $90CF). The apparent "hang" is caused by `tc_count: .byte 0` being defined
AFTER the `brk` instruction (line 478). This pushes the "Test Code" segment end address
to $90D0 (tc_count) instead of $90CF (brk). The `run_tests.sh` script extracts the segment
end address and sets a VICE breakpoint there — but $90D0 is data that's never executed, so
the breakpoint never fires. VICE hits the cycle limit and exits without processing monitor
commands (no memory dump occurs).

Fix: Move `tc_count` before `brk` (e.g., next to `tc_results`), so `brk` is the last byte
in the segment and the breakpoint fires correctly. Alternatively, eliminate tc_results and
write directly to $0400 (no store functions call msg_print, so screen RAM is safe).

**RP14-7 (LOW — inv_count_items clobbers fi_add_p1)**

`player_items.s`: `inv_count_items` reuses `fi_add_p1` as a scratch counter. This is
currently safe because `store_buy` re-sets `fi_add_p1` from the store slot data after
calling `inv_count_items` and before calling `inv_add_item`. However, this coupling is
fragile — any future caller that sets `fi_add_p1`, calls `inv_count_items`, then calls
`inv_add_item` without re-setting `fi_add_p1` would get corrupted data. Consider using
a dedicated scratch variable or a ZP temp instead.

#### Summary of Review Pass 14 findings

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix complexity | Status |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| RP14-1 | **HIGH** | Word of Recall to town skips store_restock_all | Trivial — add `jsr store_restock_all` in WoR-to-town path | **RESOLVED** — added `jsr store_restock_all` in turn.s WoR-to-town path |
| RP14-2 | **MEDIUM** | BUILDPLAN says "race modifier" for prices; implementation has charisma only | Trivial — update BUILDPLAN prose to match implementation | **RESOLVED** — Phase 8 table updated to say "charisma modifier only (race modifier deferred)" |
| RP14-3 | **MEDIUM** | Enchantment/charges ignored in pricing — all items of same type priced identically | Medium — add p1-based price bonus per category | **RESOLVED** — added `price_add_p1_bonus` in store.s: equipment +100 GP/enchant, wand/staff +10 GP/charge. New tests 18-19 verify. |
| RP14-4 | **MEDIUM** | Cursed items sellable at full base price (umoria: value 0) | Easy — check IF_CURSED in sell flow, refuse or set price 0 | **RESOLVED** — added IF_CURSED check in store_sell, displays "THAT ITEM IS CURSED." |
| RP14-5 | LOW | Store owner "max gold" mentioned in BUILDPLAN but not implemented | Trivial — update BUILDPLAN if intentionally deferred | **RESOLVED** — Phase 8 table updated to say "name only — race and max gold deferred" |
| RP14-6 | LOW | test_store.s VICE breakpoint fails — tc_count after brk shifts segment end | Trivial — move tc_count before brk | **RESOLVED** — tc_count moved before brk |
| RP14-7 | LOW | inv_count_items clobbers fi_add_p1 scratch (currently safe, fragile) | Easy — use dedicated scratch variable | **RESOLVED** — added `ici_count` dedicated scratch in item.s |

## Phase 7 — Magic System: Detailed Implementation Plan

### Current State Summary

**What exists:**
- Player struct has mana fields (`PL_MANA`=$31, `PL_MAX_MANA`=$32), spell type
  (`PL_SPELL_TYPE`=60), and `PL_SPELLS_KNOWN` 16-bit bitmask (offsets 61-62).
  16 spare bytes in player struct (offsets 63-79).
- Mana initialized in `player_create.s` (spell_stat/2, min 1). Displayed in
  `ui_status.s` and `ui_character.s`. Synced to/from ZP by `player_sync_*`.
- Command IDs defined: `CMD_CAST=$1A`, `CMD_PRAY=$1B`, `CMD_AIM=$18`,
  `CMD_USE=$19`. Key mappings exist in `input.s` but **not dispatched** in `main.s`.
- 14 status effect timers at ZP $50-$5E already ticked by `turn_tick_effects`
  in `turn.s`. Spells only need to SET timers — decrement/expiry is done.
- 3 potions (Cure Light, Speed, Poison) and 3 scrolls (Light, Identify,
  Teleportation) working with full identification system (Fisher-Yates shuffle).
- `get_direction_target` provides directional prompt (8 directions) + target
  tile calculation. `dir_dx`/`dir_dy` tables in `input.s`.
- `find_random_floor` finds an unoccupied floor tile (used by teleport scroll).
- LOS scratch at ZP $84-$87 reserved but Bresenham line trace **not implemented**.
- 20 creature types (levels 1-5). No spell/breath data in creature tables.
  Active monster entry has 2 reserved bytes (10-11).
- ~13.8 KB code space remaining ($6A00-$9FFF). 8 KB under KERNAL ROM available
  for spell tables if needed (but tables are small enough for main area).
- 5 spare ZP bytes ($4F, $5F, $6F, $8E, $8F) + scratch reuse.

**What's missing:**
- No cast/pray command dispatch. No spell list UI.
- No spell data tables (costs, levels, failure rates, effects).
- No learn-spells-on-level-up logic. No mana recalculation on level-up.
- No mana regeneration in turn processing.
- No Bresenham line trace for bolt/breath targeting.
- No wand/staff item categories or charge mechanics.
- No monster spell/breath data or ranged attack logic.
- Word of Recall timer ticks but the teleport TODO is unimplemented.

### Memory Budget

| Component | Estimated bytes |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Spell data tables (32 spells × 5 bytes + 32 name ptrs) | ~230 |
| Spell name strings (32 × avg 15 chars) | ~500 |
| `player_magic.s` (cast/pray, spell list UI, learn, failure roll) | ~1,500 |
| Shared effect subroutines (extracted + new) | ~800 |
| 16 mage spell effect handlers | ~1,200 |
| 16 priest prayer effect handlers | ~800 (many share w/ mage) |
| Expanded potions (7 new types, effect code) | ~600 |
| Expanded scrolls (7 new types, effect code) | ~700 |
| Wand/staff items + aim/use handlers + Bresenham | ~1,200 |
| Monster magic (spell data, ranged AI, breath) | ~1,500 |
| New item type SoA entries (~22 types × 8 arrays) | ~180 |
| Identification shuffle tables for new types | ~100 |
| Integration (mana regen, level-up, Word of Recall) | ~300 |
| **Total estimate** | **~9,600** |
| **Available** | **~14,100** |
| **Margin** | **~4,500 (32%)** |

### Implementation Steps

---

#### Step 7.0 — Extract Shared Effect Subroutines

**Goal:** Refactor existing potion/scroll effect code into reusable subroutines
callable from spells, potions, scrolls, wands, and staves. This is the foundation
that prevents code duplication across all of Phase 7.

**File:** `spell_effects.s` (new)

**Subroutines to extract/create:**

| Subroutine | Source | What it does |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| `eff_heal(A=amount)` | `player_items.s` quaff cure | Add pre-rolled 8-bit amount to HP, cap at max HP (16-bit). Callers roll dice separately via `math_dice`. (RP10-6: simplified from plan's dice-param API.) |
| `eff_light_room` | `player_items.s` scroll of light | Light current room tiles |
| `eff_teleport_self` | `player_items.s` scroll of teleport | find_random_floor, move player, update occupied flags |
| `eff_phase_door` | New | find_random_floor within 10 tiles of player |
| `eff_identify_prompt` | `player_items.s` scroll of identify | Prompt for slot, set id_known + IF_IDENTIFIED |
| `eff_cure_poison` | New (trivial) | `lda #0; sta zp_eff_poison` |
| `eff_detect_monsters` | New | Scan active monster table, mark positions FLAG_VISITED |
| `eff_confuse_adjacent` | New | Scan adjacent tiles, set MX_CONFUSE on monsters found |
| `eff_sleep_adjacent` | New | Scan adjacent tiles, clear MF_AWAKE + set MX_SLEEP_CUR |
| `eff_find_traps` | New | Scan visible radius, reveal hidden traps |
| `eff_find_doors` | New | Scan visible radius, reveal secret doors |
| `eff_bolt(dir, dice, sides)` | New | Bresenham line trace, damage first monster hit |
| `eff_remove_curse` | New | Scan equipment slots, clear IF_CURSED flags |
| `eff_aggravate` | New | Wake all monsters on level (set MF_AWAKE) |

**Steps:**
1. Create `spell_effects.s`. Add `#import` to `main.s`.
2. Extract `eff_heal` from `player_items.s:712-762` (the Cure Light Wounds HP
   addition + 16-bit cap logic). Parameterize: A=dice count, X=sides, Y=bonus.
   Replace original quaff code with `lda #1; ldx #8; ldy #1; jsr eff_heal`.
3. Extract `eff_light_room` from `player_items.s:910-960` (the Light scroll
   room-lighting loop). Replace original scroll code with `jsr eff_light_room`.
4. Extract `eff_teleport_self` from `player_items.s:1050-1100` (find_random_floor,
   clear old FLAG_OCCUPIED, move player, set new FLAG_OCCUPIED). Replace original
   with `jsr eff_teleport_self`.
5. Extract `eff_identify_prompt` from `player_items.s:980-1040` (prompt for
   inventory slot, set id_known, set IF_IDENTIFIED). Replace with call.
6. Write new subroutines: `eff_cure_poison`, `eff_detect_monsters`,
   `eff_confuse_adjacent`, `eff_sleep_adjacent`, `eff_find_traps`, `eff_find_doors`,
   `eff_remove_curse`, `eff_aggravate`. Each is ~30-60 bytes.
7. Write `eff_phase_door` — like `eff_teleport_self` but with distance check:
   call find_random_floor in a loop, accept first result within Chebyshev
   distance 10 of player (max 20 attempts, fall back to any floor).

**Tests:**
- Existing potion/scroll tests must still pass (verify refactor didn't break).
- New compile-time asserts for each new subroutine.
- Runtime test: `eff_heal` with known dice → verify HP change.
- Runtime test: `eff_detect_monsters` → verify monster tile gets FLAG_VISITED.

---

#### Step 7.1 — Spell Data Tables

**Goal:** Define the 32 spell/prayer data tables and name strings.

**File:** `spell_data.s` (new)

**Data structures:**

```
// Per-spell table (one array per field, 16 entries each for mage + priest)
mage_spell_mana:    .byte 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12
mage_spell_level:   .byte 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17
mage_spell_fail:    .byte 22, 23, 24, 26, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 50
priest_spell_mana:  .byte 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12
priest_spell_level: .byte 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11, 13, 15, 17
priest_spell_fail:  .byte 10, 15, 20, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 36, 38, 38, 42, 44, 46, 48, 52

// Name pointer tables (lo/hi, 16 entries each)
mage_spell_name_lo:  .byte <msn_0, <msn_1, ...
mage_spell_name_hi:  .byte >msn_0, >msn_1, ...
priest_spell_name_lo: .byte <psn_0, <psn_1, ...
priest_spell_name_hi: .byte >psn_0, >psn_1, ...

// Name strings (null-terminated PETSCII)
msn_0: .text "MAGIC MISSILE" ; .byte 0
msn_1: .text "DETECT MONSTERS" ; .byte 0
... (16 mage + 16 priest)
```

**Steps:**
1. Create `spell_data.s` with all tables above.
2. Add `#import` to `main.s`.
3. Compile-time asserts: table sizes match (16 entries each), mana values > 0,
   levels monotonically non-decreasing.

**Tests:**
- `.assert` for table element counts.
- `.assert` spot-checks: `mage_spell_mana[0] == 1`, `priest_spell_fail[15] == 52`.

---

#### Step 7.2 — Cast/Pray Commands (`player_magic.s`)

**Goal:** Implement the `m` (cast) and `p` (pray) commands. Player sees spell
list, selects a spell, failure/success is rolled, mana is deducted.

**File:** `player_magic.s` (new)

**Entry points:**
- `player_cast_spell` — called from main.s CMD_CAST dispatch
- `player_pray` — called from main.s CMD_PRAY dispatch
  (Both share most logic; only the table pointers and spell_type check differ.)

**Detailed logic for `player_cast_spell`:**
```
1. Check PL_SPELL_TYPE != SPELL_MAGE → print "YOU CANNOT CAST SPELLS." → clc, rts
2. Call spell_list_display (mage tables) — show known spells with mana costs
3. Prompt: "CAST WHICH SPELL? (A-P, ESC)" → input_get_key
4. ESC/space → cancel, clc, rts
5. Convert letter to spell index (A=0, B=1, ...)
6. Check bit in PL_SPELLS_KNOWN → if not known, "YOU DON'T KNOW THAT SPELL.", clc, rts
7. Check mana cost <= zp_player_mp → if insufficient, "NOT ENOUGH MANA.", clc, rts
8. Check spell min_level <= zp_player_lvl → if too low, "YOU'RE NOT EXPERIENCED ENOUGH.", clc, rts
9. Deduct mana: zp_player_mp -= cost; sync to player_data + PL_MANA
10. Roll failure: adjusted_fail = fail_base - 3*(level - spell_level) - spell_stat_bonus
    Clamp to [5, 95]. Roll rng_range(100): if roll < adjusted_fail → "YOUR SPELL FAILS.", sec, rts
11. Dispatch spell effect: jsr mage_effect_dispatch (CMP/BEQ chain on spell index)
12. Print effect-specific message. sec, rts (turn consumed)
```

**`spell_list_display` subroutine:**
```
1. screen_clear (or use message area — could use full-screen overlay like inventory)
2. Print header: "  SPELLS  MANA  LVL"
3. For each spell 0-15:
   a. Check if bit set in PL_SPELLS_KNOWN → if not, skip (or show "???" for unknown)
   b. Print letter (A-P), spell name, mana cost, min level
   c. If mana cost > zp_player_mp, show in dim color
4. Wait for keypress (the selection key, handled by caller)
```

**`player_pray` — identical structure but:**
- Check `PL_SPELL_TYPE == SPELL_PRIEST`
- Use `priest_spell_*` tables
- Use `priest_effect_dispatch`
- Messages say "PRAY" instead of "CAST"

**main.s dispatch additions** (insert before "Unknown command" at line ~659):
```
    // Cast spell?
    cmp #CMD_CAST
    bne !not_cast+
    jsr msg_clear
    jsr player_cast_spell
    bcc !cast_no_turn+
    jsr update_visibility     // Some spells change visibility
    jsr viewport_update
    jsr render_viewport
    jsr turn_post_action
    lda zp_game_flags
    and #$01
    beq !not_dead+
    jmp !player_died+
!not_dead:
    jsr status_draw
    jmp !main_loop-
!cast_no_turn:
    jmp !main_loop-
!not_cast:

    // Pray?
    cmp #CMD_PRAY
    bne !not_pray+
    (same pattern, calling player_pray)
!not_pray:
```

**Steps:**
1. Create `player_magic.s`. Add `#import` to `main.s`.
2. Implement `spell_list_display` — full-screen overlay showing spell list.
   Use inventory display pattern from `ui_inventory.s` as template.
3. Implement `player_cast_spell` with the 12-step logic above.
4. Implement `player_pray` (thin wrapper changing table pointers + spell type).
5. Add `CMD_CAST` and `CMD_PRAY` dispatch blocks in `main.s` (before line 659).
6. Implement `calc_spell_failure` — the failure adjustment formula:
   `adjusted = fail_base - 3*(player_level - spell_level) - spell_stat_bonus[stat-3]`
   Clamped to [5, 95]. Uses `spell_stat_bonus` table already in `tables.s`.

**Tests:**
- Compile-time: assert mana deduction arithmetic.
- Runtime test: Set player as Mage, give all spells known (PL_SPELLS_KNOWN=$FFFF),
  set mana=10, cast spell 0 (Magic Missile, cost 1). Verify mana becomes 9.
- Runtime test: Set mana=0, attempt cast → verify "NOT ENOUGH MANA", carry clear.
- Runtime test: Warrior (SPELL_NONE) attempts cast → verify rejection message.
- Runtime test: Cast unknown spell (bit not set) → verify rejection.

---

#### Step 7.3 — Learn Spells on Level-Up + Mana Recalc

**Goal:** When the player levels up, check if new spells become available.
Recalculate max mana based on level + spell stat.

**File:** `player_magic.s` (append)

**Learn-spells logic (`magic_check_new_spells`):**
```
1. Get player's spell_type. If SPELL_NONE, rts.
2. Select table pointer (mage_spell_level or priest_spell_level).
3. For each spell index 0-15:
   a. If already known (bit set in PL_SPELLS_KNOWN), skip.
   b. If spell_level[i] <= zp_player_lvl:
      - Set bit in PL_SPELLS_KNOWN (use ORA with bit mask)
      - Print "YOU HAVE LEARNED <spell name>!"
4. Sync PL_SPELLS_KNOWN to player_data.
```

**Mana recalculation (`magic_recalc_mana`):**
```
1. Get spell_type. If SPELL_NONE → max_mana = 0, rts.
2. Get spell stat (INT for mage, WIS for priest): stat = zp_player_int or zp_player_wis
3. max_mana = (level * stat) / 8 + spell_stat_bonus[stat-3]
   (Simplified from umoria; gives reasonable progression)
4. Clamp max_mana to [1, 255]
5. Store to PL_MAX_MANA and zp_player_mmp
6. If PL_MANA > max_mana, set PL_MANA = max_mana (stat drain case)
```

**Bit mask helper table:**
```
spell_bit_mask:
    .byte $01, $02, $04, $08, $10, $20, $40, $80  // Bits 0-7 (lo byte)
spell_bit_hi_mask:
    .byte $01, $02, $04, $08, $10, $20, $40, $80  // Bits 8-15 (hi byte)
```
Spells 0-7 use lo byte with `spell_bit_mask`, spells 8-15 use hi byte with
`spell_bit_hi_mask`.

**Integration into level-up** (`combat.s:519-558`):
After `jsr player_calc_combat` (line 543), add:
```
    jsr magic_recalc_mana
    jsr magic_check_new_spells
```

**Starting spells** (`player_create.s`):
After mana initialization (~line 624), add:
```
    jsr magic_check_new_spells  // Learn level-1 spells at character creation
```

**Steps:**
1. Add `spell_bit_mask` table to `spell_data.s`.
2. Implement `magic_check_new_spells` in `player_magic.s`.
3. Implement `magic_recalc_mana` in `player_magic.s`.
4. Hook `magic_recalc_mana` + `magic_check_new_spells` into `combat_check_levelup`.
5. Hook `magic_check_new_spells` into `player_create.s` after mana init.

**Tests:**
- Runtime: Create Mage at level 1 → verify spells 0-3 known (all have min_level 1).
- Runtime: Set Mage to level 3, call `magic_check_new_spells` → verify spells 4-5
  now known.
- Runtime: Verify `magic_recalc_mana` with INT=12, level=5 → expected max_mana
  = (5*12)/8 + bonus[12-3] = 7 + 1 = 8. (RP10-4: bonus[9]=1 per `spell_stat_bonus` table.)

---

#### Step 7.4 — Mage Spell Effect Dispatch

**Goal:** Implement the 16 mage spell effects.

**File:** `player_magic.s` (effect dispatch) + `spell_effects.s` (shared code)

**Dispatch table** (called after successful cast):
```
mage_effect_dispatch:
    cmp #0
    beq !mage_eff_0+    // Magic Missile
    cmp #1
    beq !mage_eff_1+    // Detect Monsters
    ... (CMP/BEQ chain)
    rts                  // Unknown — no effect (safety)
```

**Effect implementations:**

| Spell | Implementation | Shared? |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| 0 Magic Missile | `get_direction_target` → find monster at target → `math_dice(1,4,level/2)` → apply damage → kill check | New |
| 1 Detect Monsters | `jsr eff_detect_monsters` | Shared |
| 2 Phase Door | `jsr eff_phase_door` | Shared |
| 3 Light Area | `jsr eff_light_room` | Shared |
| 4 Cure Light Wounds | `lda #1; ldx #8; ldy #1; jsr eff_heal` | Shared |
| 5 Find Traps/Doors | `jsr eff_find_traps; jsr eff_find_doors` | Shared |
| 6 Stinking Cloud | `jsr eff_confuse_adjacent` | Shared |
| 7 Confusion | `get_direction_target` → find monster → set MX_CONFUSE | Partly new |
| 8 Lightning Bolt | `get_direction_target` → `lda #3; ldx #8; jsr eff_bolt` | Shared bolt |
| 9 Trap/Door Destroy | Scan radius, destroy traps + jam doors open | New |
| 10 Sleep I | `jsr eff_sleep_adjacent` | Shared |
| 11 Cure Poison | `jsr eff_cure_poison` | Shared |
| 12 Teleport Self | `jsr eff_teleport_self` | Shared |
| 13 Frost Bolt | `get_direction_target` → `lda #5; ldx #8; jsr eff_bolt` | Shared bolt |
| 14 Wall to Mud | `get_direction_target` → if wall tile, replace with floor | New |
| 15 Fire Ball | `lda #7; ldx #8; jsr eff_damage_adjacent` | New area dmg |

**New subroutines needed for this step:**
- `eff_bolt(A=dice, X=sides)` — Bresenham line trace from player in chosen
  direction. Step through tiles; stop at wall. If monster found, roll damage,
  apply to monster HP, check kill. Uses ZP $84-$87 for line state.
- `eff_damage_adjacent(A=dice, X=sides)` — Scan 8 adjacent tiles for monsters,
  roll damage for each, apply, check kills.
- `eff_directional_monster` — `get_direction_target`, find monster at target
  tile. Returns monster index in X or carry clear if no monster.

**Bresenham bolt algorithm (`eff_bolt`):**
```
1. Get direction from get_direction_target. Extract dx, dy from dir_dx/dir_dy.
2. Start at player position (px, py). Step: x += dx, y += dy each iteration.
3. For each step (max 20 iterations — longest dungeon dimension):
   a. Check bounds (0 < x < MAP_W-1, 0 < y < MAP_H-1).
   b. Read map tile. If wall → stop (bolt hits wall, no damage).
   c. Check for monster at (x, y) via monster_find_at.
   d. If monster found → roll damage, apply, check kill. Stop.
4. If bolt exits map or reaches max range → fizzle.
```
Note: This is a simplified "straight-line" bolt, not a full Bresenham with
fractional error — movement is exactly along the 8 cardinal/diagonal directions,
one tile per step. This matches how `dir_dx`/`dir_dy` work and is sufficient
for the dungeon's grid-based geometry.

**Steps:**
1. Implement `eff_bolt` in `spell_effects.s`.
2. Implement `eff_damage_adjacent` in `spell_effects.s`.
3. Implement `eff_directional_monster` in `spell_effects.s`.
4. Implement `mage_effect_dispatch` in `player_magic.s` with all 16 effects.
5. Hook up to `player_cast_spell` (JSR to dispatch after successful cast).

**Tests:**
- Runtime test: Cast Magic Missile with monster adjacent → verify damage applied.
- Runtime test: Cast Light Area → verify room tiles get FLAG_LIT.
- Runtime test: Cast Teleport Self → verify player moved.
- Runtime test: Cast Lightning Bolt toward monster 3 tiles away → verify damage.
- Runtime test: Cast Lightning Bolt toward wall → verify no damage, bolt stops.
- Runtime test: Cast Cure Light Wounds → verify HP increases.

---

#### Step 7.5 — Priest Prayer Effect Dispatch

**Goal:** Implement the 16 priest prayer effects. Many share code with mage spells.

**File:** `player_magic.s` (append)

**Dispatch + implementations:**

| Prayer | Implementation | Shared with |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 0 Detect Evil | `jsr eff_detect_monsters` | Mage #1 |
| 1 Cure Light Wounds | `lda #1; ldx #8; ldy #1; jsr eff_heal` | Mage #4 |
| 2 Bless | `lda #12; jsr rng_range; clc; adc #12; sta zp_eff_bless` | New (tiny) |
| 3 Remove Fear | (Placeholder — clear future fear timer) | New (tiny) |
| 4 Call Light | `jsr eff_light_room` | Mage #3 |
| 5 Find Traps | `jsr eff_find_traps` | Mage #5 (half) |
| 6 Detect Doors/Stairs | `jsr eff_find_doors` (incl stairs) | Mage #5 (half) |
| 7 Slow Poison | `lda zp_eff_poison; lsr; ora #1; sta zp_eff_poison` | New (tiny) |
| 8 Blind Creature | `jsr eff_directional_monster` → set stun on monster | New |
| 9 Portal | `jsr eff_phase_door` | Mage #2 |
| 10 Cure Medium Wounds | `lda #3; ldx #8; ldy #3; jsr eff_heal` | Shared heal |
| 11 Chant | `lda #24; jsr rng_range; clc; adc #24; sta zp_eff_bless` | Like Bless |
| 12 Sanctuary | `jsr eff_sleep_adjacent` | Mage #10 |
| 13 Remove Curse | `jsr eff_remove_curse` | Shared |
| 14 Cure Serious Wounds | `lda #5; ldx #8; ldy #5; jsr eff_heal` | Shared heal |
| 15 Dispel Undead | Scan visible monsters, if undead → 1d3*level damage | New |

**New monster flag needed:** `CF_UNDEAD = $02` in `cr_mflags`. No current tier-0
monsters are undead, but the flag is needed for future tiers. Dispel Undead will
check `cr_mflags[type] & CF_UNDEAD` before applying damage. For now, this spell
effectively does nothing (no undead in levels 1-5), which is correct — priests
learn it at level 17 and should be in deeper tiers by then.

**Steps:**
1. Add `CF_UNDEAD` constant to `monster.s`.
2. Implement `priest_effect_dispatch` in `player_magic.s`.
3. Each shared effect is a JSR to the corresponding subroutine.
4. Implement Bless/Chant (set `zp_eff_bless` timer with different durations).
5. Implement Blind Creature (directional monster + set MX_STUN timer).
6. Implement Dispel Undead (scan active monsters, check CF_UNDEAD, damage).

**Tests:**
- Runtime: Priest casts Bless → verify zp_eff_bless > 0.
- Runtime: Priest casts Cure Medium Wounds → verify HP gain is in [6, 27] range.
- Runtime: Priest casts Remove Curse with cursed equipped item → verify IF_CURSED
  cleared.
- Runtime: Priest casts Slow Poison with poison timer 10 → verify timer becomes 5.

---

#### Step 7.6 — Expanded Potions and Scrolls ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Goal:** Add 7 new potions and 7 new scrolls. Expand item type tables and
identification system. ITEM_TYPE_COUNT goes from 25 → 39.

**Files modified:** `item.s`, `player_items.s`, `zeropage.s`, `combat.s`,
`tests/test_item.s`, `run_tests.sh`

**New item types (14 total, IDs 25-38):**

| ID | Category | Name | Effect |
|----|----------|------|--------|
| 25 | Potion | Cure Serious Wounds | Heal 5d8+5 via eff_heal |
| 26 | Potion | Restore Mana | Set zp_player_mp = zp_player_mmp |
| 27 | Potion | Heroism | Set zp_eff_hero timer (rng(25)+25) |
| 28 | Potion | Blindness | Set zp_eff_blind timer (rng(100)+100) — harmful |
| 29 | Potion | Confusion | Set zp_eff_confuse timer (rng(15)+10) — harmful |
| 30 | Potion | Detect Monsters | jsr eff_detect_monsters |
| 31 | Potion | Infravision | Set zp_eff_infra timer (rng(50)+50) |
| 32 | Scroll | Word of Recall | Set zp_eff_word_recall (rng(15)+15) |
| 33 | Scroll | Remove Curse | jsr eff_remove_curse |
| 34 | Scroll | Enchant Weapon | Find EQUIP_WEAPON, inc inv_p1 (cap +5) |
| 35 | Scroll | Enchant Armor | Find EQUIP_BODY, inc inv_p1 (cap +5) |
| 36 | Scroll | Monster Confusion | Set zp_confuse_melee = 1 |
| 37 | Scroll | Aggravate | jsr eff_aggravate |
| 38 | Scroll | Protect from Evil | Set zp_eff_protect timer (rng(25)+25) |

**What was implemented:**

1. **`zeropage.s`** — Renamed `zp_spare_4f` → `zp_confuse_melee` ($4f): flag for
   Monster Confusion scroll's one-time confuse-on-melee-hit effect.

2. **`item.s` — SoA table extensions (14 new entries):**
   - Extended all 10 SoA arrays (`it_category`, `it_display`, `it_color`,
     `it_weight`, `it_dmg_dice`, `it_dmg_sides`, `it_base_ac`, `it_cost_lo/hi`,
     `it_min_level`) from 25 → 39 entries.
   - Added 14 name strings (`itn_25`..`itn_38`), extended `it_name_lo/hi`.
   - Extended `id_known` with 14× 0 (unknown at start).

3. **`item.s` — Lookup tables for non-contiguous type IDs:**
   - Potion types at IDs 17-19 and 25-31 are non-contiguous; scrolls at 20-22
     and 32-38. The old `sbc #17` / `sbc #20` approach breaks.
   - Added two 39-byte lookup tables: `potion_local_idx` and `scroll_local_idx`.
     Indexed by type ID → local category index (0-9), or $FF if not that category.
   - Rewrote `item_get_name_ptr` and `item_get_floor_color` potion/scroll branches
     to use lookup tables instead of subtraction.

4. **`item.s` — Expanded identification system:**
   - Expanded shuffle tables from 5 to 12 entries each (10 types, 12 descriptors).
   - Added 7 new potion descriptors: "AZURE", "SMOKY", "BROWN", "SILVER", "PINK",
     "CLOUDY", "GOLDEN".
   - Added 7 new scroll descriptors: "LUMEN", "VERITAS", "DURA", "LIBERA",
     "ACUTA", "FEROX", "TUTELA" (Latin-themed).
   - Expanded `potion_name_lo/hi`, `scroll_name_lo/hi` from 5 to 12 entries.
   - Expanded `potion_colors`, `scroll_colors` from 5 to 12 entries.
   - Updated `item_init_identification`: shuffle init `ldx #4` → `ldx #11`,
     Fisher-Yates loops `ldx #4` → `ldx #11`.

5. **`item.s` — Updated `pick_item_type`:**
   - Changed range from `rng_range(23) + 2` → `rng_range(37) + 2` (giving [2,38]).

6. **`item.s` — Updated compile-time asserts:**
   - `ITEM_TYPE_COUNT` assert from 25 to 39.

7. **`player_items.s` — 7 new potion handlers in `item_quaff`:**
   - CSW: Roll 5d8 via loop, add 5, jsr eff_heal. Msg: "YOU FEEL MUCH BETTER."
   - Restore Mana: Set MP=max MP. Msg: "YOUR MIND FEELS CLEAR."
   - Heroism: Timer → zp_eff_hero. Msg: "YOU FEEL HEROIC!"
   - Blindness: Timer → zp_eff_blind. Msg: "YOU CAN'T SEE!"
   - Confusion: Timer → zp_eff_confuse. Msg: "YOU FEEL DIZZY."
   - Detect Monsters: jsr eff_detect_monsters. Msg: "YOU SENSE NEARBY CREATURES."
   - Infravision: Timer → zp_eff_infra. Msg: "YOUR EYES TINGLE."
   - Dispatch uses JMP trampolines for branch distance.

8. **`player_items.s` — 7 new scroll handlers in `item_read_scroll`:**
   - Word of Recall: Timer → zp_eff_word_recall. Msg: "THE AIR CRACKLES AROUND YOU."
   - Remove Curse: jsr eff_remove_curse. Msg: "YOU FEEL CLEANSED."
   - Enchant Weapon: Inc inv_p1 at EQUIP_WEAPON (cap +5). Msg: "YOUR WEAPON GLOWS BRIEFLY."
   - Enchant Armor: Inc inv_p1 at EQUIP_BODY (cap +5). Msg: "YOUR ARMOR GLOWS BRIEFLY."
   - Monster Confusion: Set zp_confuse_melee=1. Msg: "YOUR HANDS BEGIN TO GLOW."
   - Aggravate: jsr eff_aggravate. Msg: "YOU HEAR A HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING."
   - Protect from Evil: Timer → zp_eff_protect. Msg: "YOU FEEL PROTECTED."
   - No weapon/armor → "YOU FEEL A STRANGE VIBRATION." (enchant scrolls).
   - 17 new message strings added.

9. **`combat.s` — Confuse-on-hit check:**
   - After `sta cmb_any_hit` (first hit scored), checks `zp_confuse_melee`.
   - If set: clears flag (one-time use), sets monster MX_CONFUSE timer to 20.
   - zp_ptr0 still points to monster entry (set by `monster_get_ptr` earlier).

10. **`tests/test_item.s` — 6 new runtime tests (tests 33-38):**
    - Test 33: CSW potion heals HP in [60, 95] (from 50, heal 10-45).
    - Test 34: Restore Mana sets MP = max MP (5 → 30).
    - Test 35: Enchant Weapon scroll increments p1 (2 → 3).
    - Test 36: Word of Recall sets zp_eff_word_recall in [15, 29].
    - Test 37: Blindness potion sets zp_eff_blind in [100, 199].
    - Test 38: pick_item_type returns new types (>= 25) at deep dungeon levels.
    - Updated test 21 range check from `cmp #25` → `cmp #39`.
    - Expanded tc_results buffer from 30 → 40, copy loop from 31 → 37.

11. **`run_tests.sh`** — Updated item test expected count from 32 → 38,
    result range from `0400 041f` → `0400 0425`.

**Shared subroutines reused from `spell_effects.s`:**
- `eff_heal` (line 28) — add pre-rolled amount to player HP
- `eff_detect_monsters` (line 264) — reveal monsters on map
- `eff_remove_curse` (line 313) — clear IF_CURSED on equipment
- `eff_aggravate` (line 1046) — wake all monsters

**Verification:**
- `make build` → 56 asserts, 0 failed ✅
- `make test` → 12/12 suites pass (item: 38/38 tests) ✅

#### Step 7.7 — Wands and Staves

**Goal:** Implement wand aiming and staff usage with charge tracking.

**Files:** `player_items.s` (new `item_aim_wand`, `item_use_staff`), `main.s`
(dispatch), `item.s` (SoA entries)

**Charge tracking:** Use `inv_p1` as charge count (already exists per inventory
slot). When item is spawned, set p1 to initial charge count. Each use decrements
p1. At 0 charges, "THE WAND HAS NO CHARGES LEFT." or "THE STAFF IS EMPTY."

**`item_aim_wand` logic:**
```
1. Prompt: "AIM WHICH WAND? (A-V, ESC)"
2. Validate: slot occupied, category == ICAT_WAND.
3. If charges (inv_p1) == 0 → "NO CHARGES LEFT.", clc, rts.
4. jsr get_direction_target → get direction for bolt/effect.
5. Decrement inv_p1. Auto-identify wand type (set id_known).
6. Dispatch by item ID:
   - Wand of Light (39): jsr eff_light_room (direction ignored)
   - Wand of Lightning (40): lda #3; ldx #8; jsr eff_bolt
   - Wand of Frost (41): lda #4; ldx #8; jsr eff_bolt
   - Wand of Stinking Cloud (42): jsr eff_directional_monster → set MX_CONFUSE
7. sec, rts (turn consumed).
```

**`item_use_staff` logic:**
```
1. Prompt: "USE WHICH STAFF? (A-V, ESC)"
2. Validate: slot occupied, category == ICAT_STAFF.
3. If charges == 0 → "THE STAFF IS EMPTY.", clc, rts.
4. Decrement inv_p1. Auto-identify.
5. Dispatch by item ID:
   - Staff of Light (43): jsr eff_light_room
   - Staff of Detect Monsters (44): jsr eff_detect_monsters
   - Staff of Teleportation (45): jsr eff_teleport_self
   - Staff of Cure Light Wounds (46): lda #1; ldx #8; ldy #1; jsr eff_heal
6. sec, rts.
```

**main.s dispatch** (add before CMD_CAST):
```
    cmp #CMD_AIM

    bcc !use_no_turn+
    ... (standard post-action block)
!not_use:
```

**Wand/staff spawning:** Add to `roll_item_type` — wands and staves appear
starting at dungeon level 3. Initial charges set in spawn: wands get
`rng_range(4)+5` charges (5-8), staves get `rng_range(6)+3` (3-8), except
Light variants get `rng_range(6)+10` (10-15).

**Identification:** Add unidentified name shuffle for wands (4 types need 5+
descriptors): "IRON", "COPPER", "SILVER", "BONE", "OAK". For staves:
"BIRCH", "PINE", "MAPLE", "WILLOW", "ASH".

**Steps:**
1. Add SoA entries for wand/staff item types (IDs 39-46) to `item.s`.
2. Add wand/staff descriptor tables and shuffle to `item.s`.
3. Implement `item_aim_wand` in `player_items.s`.
4. Implement `item_use_staff` in `player_items.s`.
5. Add CMD_AIM + CMD_USE dispatch in `main.s`.
6. Update spawn tables to include wands/staves.

**Tests:**
- Runtime: Aim Wand of Lightning at monster → verify damage applied, charges decremented.
- Runtime: Aim Wand with 0 charges → verify "NO CHARGES" message, no turn consumed.
- Runtime: Use Staff of Teleportation → verify player moved, charges decremented.
- Runtime: Verify wand/staff identification on first use.

#### Step 7.8 — Monster Magic (`monster_magic.s`)

**Goal:** Monsters with spellcasting ability can use ranged spells and breath
weapons instead of (or in addition to) melee attacks.

**File:** `monster_magic.s` (new)

**New creature data arrays** (add to `monster.s`):
```
// Spell chance: probability out of 100 that monster casts instead of moving.
// 0 = never casts (melee only). Only checked when monster is awake and in range.
cr_spell_chance:
    .byte 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0  // Tier 0: no spellcasters
    .byte 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

// Spell flags: bitmask of available spells/abilities.
// Bit 0: bolt attack, Bit 1: breath weapon, Bit 2: summon,
// Bit 3: teleport-to, Bit 4: blind, Bit 5: confuse, Bit 6: heal self
cr_spell_flags:
    .byte 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0  // Tier 0: all zero
    .byte 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```

All tier-0 values are 0 (no spellcasters in levels 1-5). The infrastructure is
built now so that future creature tiers can set non-zero values.

**Range/LOS check (`monster_can_cast`):**
```
1. Check cr_spell_chance[type] > 0. If 0 → carry clear, rts.
2. Calculate Chebyshev distance between monster and player.
   If distance > MAX_CAST_RANGE (8) → carry clear, rts.
3. Check line-of-sight: step from monster toward player using dir_dx/dir_dy
   (same as bolt trace). If any wall tile blocks → carry clear, rts.
4. Roll rng_range(100). If >= cr_spell_chance → carry clear, rts (chose melee).
5. Carry set → monster casts a spell.
```

**Monster spell selection (`monster_pick_spell`):**
```
1. Get cr_spell_flags[type].
2. Count set bits. Pick random one via rng_range(count).
3. Map selected bit to spell handler:
   - Bit 0 (bolt): monster_cast_bolt — 2d8 + level damage along line to player
   - Bit 1 (breath): monster_cast_breath — damage = current HP / 3, along line
   - Bit 2 (summon): monster_cast_summon — spawn a new monster adjacent to caster
   - Bit 3 (teleport-to): monster_cast_teleport — move player to random location
   - Bit 4 (blind): monster_cast_blind — set zp_eff_blind = 10+1d10
   - Bit 5 (confuse): monster_cast_confuse — set zp_eff_confuse = 5+1d5
   - Bit 6 (heal): monster_cast_heal — heal self 3d8 HP
```

**Integration into `monster_ai.s`:**

In `monster_process_one`, before the movement/melee decision (~the point where
an awake monster decides to approach or attack):
```
    // Check if monster wants to cast a spell
    jsr monster_can_cast
    bcc !no_cast+
    jsr monster_pick_spell
    jmp !mon_done+          // Casting used the monster's turn
!no_cast:
    // Normal movement/melee continues...
```

**Breath weapon damage:**
```
monster_cast_breath:
    // Damage = current HP / 3 (integer division)
    // Load HP (16-bit), divide by 3 using math_div_16x8
    lda mx_hp_lo,x    → zp_math_a
    lda mx_hp_hi,x    → zp_math_b
    ldx #3
    jsr math_div_16x8
    // Result in zp_math_a (lo). Apply as damage to player.
    // Cap at 255 for single-byte damage.
```

**Steps:**
1. Create `monster_magic.s`. Add `#import` to `main.s`.
2. Add `cr_spell_chance` and `cr_spell_flags` arrays to `monster.s` (all zeros
   for tier 0).
3. Implement `monster_can_cast` (range check + LOS + probability roll).
4. Implement `monster_pick_spell` (select from available spells).
5. Implement individual monster spell handlers (bolt, breath, summon, teleport,
   blind, confuse, heal).
6. Hook into `monster_process_one` in `monster_ai.s`.
7. Add monster spell messages: "THE <name> BREATHES FIRE!", "THE <name> CASTS
   A SPELL!", etc.

**Tests:**
- Compile-time: assert cr_spell_chance/cr_spell_flags table sizes = CREATURE_COUNT.
- Runtime: Set up monster with spell_chance=100, spell_flags=1 (bolt only), place
  within range. Run monster_process_one → verify player takes damage.
- Runtime: Set spell_chance=0 → verify monster_can_cast returns carry clear.
- Runtime: Place wall between monster and player → verify LOS blocked.
- Runtime: Breath weapon with monster at 30 HP → verify damage = 10.

#### Step 7.9 — Mana Regeneration + Word of Recall

**Goal:** Mana regenerates over time. Word of Recall timer, when expired,
teleports the player between town and dungeon.

**File:** `turn.s` (extend `turn_tick_effects`)

**Mana regeneration** (add to `turn_tick_effects` after HP regen):
```
// Mana regen: spell-casting classes recover 1 mana per 2 turns
// (Modified by zp_eff_regen: if active, recover 1 every turn)
    lda player_data + PL_SPELL_TYPE
    beq !no_mana_regen+              // Warriors don't regen mana
    lda zp_player_mp
    cmp zp_player_mmp
    bcs !no_mana_regen+              // Already at max
    lda zp_turn_lo
    and #$01                         // Every 2 turns (basic rate)
    bne !no_mana_regen+
    inc zp_player_mp
    lda zp_player_mp
    sta player_data + PL_MANA
!no_mana_regen:
```

**Word of Recall implementation** (in `turn.s`, replace TODO at line ~141):
```
// Word of Recall expired — teleport
    lda zp_player_dlvl
    beq !recall_to_dungeon+
    // In dungeon → go to town (dlvl 0)
    lda #0
    sta zp_player_dlvl
    jmp !recall_generate+
!recall_to_dungeon:
    // In town → go to max depth reached
    lda player_data + PL_MAX_DLVL   // Need to track max depth
    beq !no_recall+                  // Never been to dungeon
    sta zp_player_dlvl
!recall_generate:
    jsr level_generate
    jsr monster_spawn_level
    jsr item_spawn_level
    jsr update_visibility
    jsr screen_clear
    jsr viewport_update
    jsr render_viewport
    lda #<recall_arrive_str
    sta zp_ptr0
    lda #>recall_arrive_str
    sta zp_ptr0_hi
    jsr msg_print
!no_recall:
```

**Max depth tracking:** Use `PL_MAX_DLVL` (player struct offset 56) to store
the deepest dungeon level reached. Update when descending stairs:
```
// In main.s stairs-down handler, after incrementing zp_player_dlvl:
    lda zp_player_dlvl
    cmp player_data + PL_MAX_DLVL
    bcc !no_update_max+
    sta player_data + PL_MAX_DLVL
!no_update_max:
```

**Steps:**
1. `PL_MAX_DLVL` is at offset 56 in `player.s`. Initialize to 0 in
   `player_create.s`.
2. Add max depth tracking to stairs-down handler in `main.s`.
3. Add mana regen block to `turn_tick_effects` in `turn.s`.
4. Replace Word of Recall TODO with full implementation in `turn.s`.
5. Add recall message strings.

**Tests:**
- Runtime: Mage with mp < mmp, tick 2 turns → verify mp increased by 1.
- Runtime: Warrior → verify no mana regen.
- Runtime: Set zp_eff_word_recall = 1, tick one turn → verify dungeon level changed.
- Runtime: In town (dlvl 0) with max_dlvl=3, recall → verify dlvl becomes 3.

#### Step 7.10 — Integration, Polish, and Full Test Pass

**Goal:** Wire everything together, verify all commands work end-to-end,
fix edge cases.

**Checklist:**

1. **Verify all 4 new commands work** (m=cast, p=pray, a=aim, z=use):
   - Each prints appropriate message on success/failure.
   - Each correctly consumes/doesn't consume a turn.
   - Cancellation works cleanly at every prompt.

2. **Confusion interaction with casting:**
   - If `zp_eff_confuse > 0`, casting should have a high chance of failure or
     random spell selection (umoria randomly picks a spell when confused).
   - Add confusion check at start of `player_cast_spell`/`player_pray`.

3. **Blindness interaction:**
   - Blind player can't read scrolls (`item_read_scroll` should check
     `zp_eff_blind` and refuse: "YOU CAN'T SEE TO READ.").
   - Blind player can still quaff potions, use staves, cast from memory.

4. **Hunger interaction:**
   - At "FAINT" hunger level, spell casting should have increased failure rate
     (add +20 to failure roll when `zp_hunger_state >= HUNGER_FAINT`).

5. **Sound effects:**
   - Add `SFX_SPELL` to `sound.s` — short mystical tone for successful cast.
   - Add `SFX_SPELL_FAIL` — low buzz for failed cast.

6. **Update help screen** (`ui_help.s`):
   - Add M=cast spell, P=pray, A=aim wand, Z=use staff to key listing.

7. **Update character sheet** (`ui_character.s`):
   - Add "Spells Known: N/16" line.

8. **Status bar** (`ui_status.s`):
   - Already displays mana. Verify it updates after casting.

9. **Save/load compatibility note** (for future Phase 9):
   - Document that save format must include: PL_SPELLS_KNOWN (2 bytes),
     PL_MAX_DLVL (1 byte), all effect timers, inventory charges.

**Final test matrix:**

| Test | Command | Scenario | Expected |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| Cast all 16 mage spells | M | Sufficient mana, spell known | Each effect applies |
| Pray all 16 prayers | P | Sufficient mana, prayer known | Each effect applies |
| Cast with no mana | M | mp=0 | "NOT ENOUGH MANA", no turn |
| Cast as Warrior | M | class=Warrior | "YOU CANNOT CAST SPELLS" |
| Pray as Mage | P | class=Mage | "YOU CANNOT PRAY" |
| Aim wand at monster | A | Monster in line, charges > 0 | Damage/effect, charge-1 |
| Aim empty wand | A | charges=0 | "NO CHARGES LEFT", no turn |
| Use staff | Z | charges > 0 | Effect applies, charge-1 |
| Quaff new potions | Q | Each new type | Effect applies correctly |
| Read new scrolls | R | Each new type | Effect applies correctly |
| Level-up spell learn | — | Mage gains level 3 | Spells 4-5 now known |
| Mana regen | — | mp < mmp, 2 turns | mp+1 |
| Word of Recall | — | Timer expires in dungeon | Return to town |
| Monster spell (future) | — | Spell-capable monster in range | Player takes damage |
| Confusion + cast | M | Confused | Random spell or auto-fail |
| Blind + read scroll | R | Blind | "CAN'T SEE TO READ" |

Step 7.10 (Integration/Polish) ─── all steps complete
```

**Recommended implementation sequence:**
1. **7.0** → 2. **7.1** → 3. **7.2** + **7.3** → 4. **7.4** → 5. **7.5** →
6. **7.6** → 7. **7.7** → 8. **7.8** → 9. **7.9** → 10. **7.10**

Each step is independently testable and committable. Steps 7.4 and 7.5 can
potentially be done in one pass since they share the dispatch pattern. Steps
7.6 and 7.7 are largely independent of the spell system (they're item-based)
and could be parallelized.
