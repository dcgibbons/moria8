# Chargen Hang Recovery Plan

## Objective

Resolve the C128 character-creation hang that occurs after gender selection.
Current monitor traces show execution still inside the startup overlay at
`player_create`, specifically in the background generation / word-wrap path,
before any character-summary path is reached.

## Facts Established

- The current hang is **not** in the summary display path.
- Recent summary-related edits changed control flow, but the latest trace at
  `$E58A` is still inside chargen overlay code.
- The current workspace contains experimental changes plus backup files, so we
  need a clean diagnostic baseline before making more behavioral edits.

## Plan

Superseded by the later `$1000` / `JSR $1000` Bank 1 trace.

- [ ] Revert only the experimental summary-path changes in `commodore/common/player_create.s` and `commodore/c128/main.s`.
- [ ] Remove backup artifacts created during the failed experiment review from the working set, or at minimum exclude them from further diagnosis.
- [ ] Rebuild C128 and confirm the baseline hang still reproduces after gender selection.
- [ ] Map the `$E58A` / `$E588` overlay addresses back to the exact labels and loop in `create_gen_background` / `bg_word_wrap`.
- [ ] Add narrow runtime probes around background chart selection, string append, terminator placement, and wrap-loop progress.
- [ ] Verify whether the failure is caused by a missing terminator, bad chart chain, bad break condition, or output pointer overrun.
- [ ] Apply the smallest root-cause fix in the background-generation path.
- [ ] Rebuild and verify normal chargen reaches the summary screen.
- [ ] Re-run any relevant targeted tests and do one manual C128 verification pass.

## Executed Fix Plan

- [x] Confirm `viewport_update` is linked at `$1000` while `bank1.dat` was emitted with an `$E000` PRG header.
- [x] Confirm no runtime Stage 2 loader existed for `bank1.dat`.
- [x] Change `Bank1Data` to emit a `$1000` PRG matching its runtime addresses.
- [x] Add a C128-safe runtime loader for `bank1.dat` using the existing KERNAL wrapper path.
- [x] Load `bank1.dat` during startup before any gameplay path can call `viewport_update`.
- [x] Rebuild, regenerate the D64, and run targeted smokes that exercise chargen through first render.

## Review

- Root cause was not chargen summary code. `viewport_update` and related VDC routines are linked at low RAM `$1000`, but `bank1.dat` was never loaded at runtime and the PRG itself still carried an `$E000` load header.
- First repair attempt loaded `bank1.dat` into Bank 1, which was still wrong because normal runtime executes in `MMU_ALL_RAM` (Bank 0) and calls `$1000` directly.
- Correct fix is to emit `bank1.dat` with a `$1000` header and load it into Bank 0 low RAM during startup before the title menu is shown.
- Validation:
  - `make -B -C commodore/c128 build128` ✅
  - `make -C commodore/c128 disk128` ✅
  - `run_boot_title_newgame_smoke` ✅
  - `run_scripted_summary_to_town_smoke` ✅

## 2026-03-18 follow-up
- New failure: CPU JAM at $1016 after sex selection. Backtrace shows `JSR $1000` from $B2D9, and runtime memory at $1016 contains text (`DIRECTORY...`), not executable code.
- Conclusion: chargen progressed farther; current active bug is Bank 1 low-memory runtime corruption or missing staging/loading for `viewport_update` at $1000.
- Next: trace how `BANK1.DAT` is loaded/relocated into Bank 1 reclaimed low RAM ($1000-$3FFF), then patch the root cause.

## 2026-03-18 follow-up 2
- New trace after the first loader fix still JAMs on `JSR $1000`, now with garbage bytes rather than BASIC text.
- Conclusion: the direct `$1000` call executes in visible Bank 0 runtime context, so loading `bank1.dat` into Bank 1 was insufficient.
- Next: retarget the startup loader to Bank 0 low RAM and re-run targeted smokes.

## 2026-03-18 follow-up 2
- New trace after loader fix: CPU JAM still occurs on `JSR $1000`, now with garbage at `$10DA`/`$1016` instead of BASIC text.
- Key implication: the call executes in currently visible Bank 0 context; loading `bank1.dat` only into Bank 1 does not make `$1000` executable from that path.
- Next: prove intended residency/execution bank for `$1000` code, then retarget the loader or trampoline accordingly.

## 2026-03-18 follow-up 3
- Main blocker fixed: game now reaches town. New bug: character summary screen auto-dismisses without a fresh keypress.
- Hypothesis: the gender-selection key is still considered active when summary dismissal runs, so `input_wait_release` / `input_get_key` sequencing is incomplete on this path.
- Next: trace `create_select_gender`, `tramp_player_create`, and `input_wait_release` / `input_get_key`, then patch the smallest fix and verify with the scripted summary smoke.

## 2026-03-18 final outcome
- Root cause of the two-week blocker was the missing/incorrect low-RAM runtime loader contract for callable `$1000` VDC code, not chargen summary logic.
- Final fix: emit `bank1.dat` with a `$1000` header, load it into Bank 0 low RAM during startup, and harden the summary release path for normal-speed runs.
- Manual validation now reaches town successfully; the summary auto-dismiss symptom was only reproduced during warp-mode testing.
