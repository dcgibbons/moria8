# Lessons Learned

## VDC Hardware Fill (C128)

- **Issue:** Using VDC hardware fill (Reg 30) for `screen_clear` and `screen_clear_row` caused a fatal CPU crash (JAM) during character creation (after pressing 'N' on the title screen).
- **Symptom:** CPU jumps to an invalid address (e.g., $A94E) and executes an operand as an opcode.
- **Root Cause:** Likely a timing or race condition between the VDC's internal hardware fill operation and the CPU's subsequent register access, or an interaction with the KERNAL's interrupt-driven VDC access (even with `sei`). VDC hardware fill takes several milliseconds; if not polled correctly or if a register is selected mid-operation, the VDC status or data register state can become corrupted.
- **Resolution:** Revert to streaming loops for block clears. While slower, streaming with `vdc_wait` per byte is deterministic and avoids the complexity of managing the VDC's internal state during autonomous hardware operations.
- **Rule:** **Prefer streaming loops over hardware fill (Reg 30)** for block operations unless the performance gain is absolutely critical and the busy-state management is exhaustively verified.
