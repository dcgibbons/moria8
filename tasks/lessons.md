# Lessons Learned

## VDC Hardware Fill (C128)

- **Issue:** Using VDC hardware fill (Reg 30) for `screen_clear` and `screen_clear_row` caused a fatal CPU crash (JAM) during character creation (after pressing 'N' on the title screen).
- **Symptom:** CPU jumps to an invalid address (e.g., $A94E) and executes an operand as an opcode.
- **Root Cause:** Likely a timing or race condition between the VDC's internal hardware fill operation and the CPU's subsequent register access, or an interaction with the KERNAL's interrupt-driven VDC access (even with `sei`). VDC hardware fill takes several milliseconds; if not polled correctly or if a register is selected mid-operation, the VDC status or data register state can become corrupted.
- **Resolution:** Revert to streaming loops for block clears. While slower, streaming with `vdc_wait` per byte is deterministic and avoids the complexity of managing the VDC's internal state during autonomous hardware operations.
- **Rule:** **Prefer streaming loops over hardware fill (Reg 30)** for block operations unless the performance gain is absolutely critical and the busy-state management is exhaustively verified.

## Overlays and Banked Payload Overlap (C128)

- **Issue:** A CPU JAM (crash) at $76CB (inside `item_get_name_ptr`) occurred when entering the dungeon from town.
- **Root Cause:** The `DungeonGenOverlay` (loaded at $E000-$EFFF) was overwriting the beginning of the `banked_payload` (relocated to $EB00). Specifically, `ego_items.s` was being corrupted. When `item_spawn_level` called `tramp_roll_ego_type`, it jumped into the overwritten memory, leading to an eventual crash in the main segment code.
- **Resolution:** Moved `special_rooms.s` and `ego_items.s` to the end of the `banked_payload` block. Since the total payload size is ~4.6KB and it starts at $EB00, the last ~700 bytes (which include these critical shared routines) now reside at $F900+, safely beyond the largest 4KB overlay.
- **Rule:** **Always verify overlay overlap with resident banked code.** On the C128, ensure that any code in the $EB00-$EFFF range is truly disposable while an overlay is active. If shared code is needed *during* overlay execution, it must be placed at $F000+ or included within the overlay itself.
